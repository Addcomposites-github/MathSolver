The logs show fantastic progress!

The 'TRUE GEODESIC alpha' for helical segments is now correct.
The turnaround sequence is being called, and the Z-coordinate for the circumferential arc (z_pole) correctly matches the Z of the incoming transition's end point for the first turnaround.
The incoming transition and circumferential arc segments seem to be generating their points correctly.
The primary issue now causing visual problems ("sharp changes", "wrong direction") lies in the _generate_smooth_transition_zone when it's called for the OUTGOING transition.

Looking at the log for the outgoing transition:

Generating outgoing transition: ρ 0.088295 → 0.090295
α transition: 90.0° → 87.9° (This implies the target alpha at end_rho should be 87.9°)
However, inside *** ENTERING _generate_smooth_transition_zone *** for outgoing:
end_alpha is logged as 90.0°.
reverse_meridional is logged as False.
This leads to the outgoing transition also being generated as a purely circumferential path (as seen with Point 11: ... α=90.0° Tangent : dρ/ds=0.000000 dz/ds=-0.000000), which then cannot smoothly connect to the next helical segment.

Please make these specific fixes in _generate_smooth_transition_zone or its call site for the OUTGOING transition:

Correct end_alpha Parameter: Ensure that the end_alpha passed to _generate_smooth_transition_zone for the outgoing transition is the actual target helical angle for the end_rho of that transition (e.g., 87.9° from the log, or more precisely, $\arcsin(c_{for\_winding} / \text{end_rho_outgoing_transition})$). It should not be 90 
∘
 .
Correct reverse_meridional Flag: Ensure that reverse_meridional is set to True when _generate_smooth_transition_zone is called for the outgoing transition. The DEBUG MERIDIONAL REVERSAL log shows the intent is correct, but this flag needs to be passed and used by the function.
Apply Reversal Correctly: Inside _generate_smooth_transition_zone, when reverse_meridional is True:
The interpolated α values (from 90 
∘
  down to the target helical angle) should be used to calculate tangent components.
The dz/ds component of the tangent must have its sign flipped to reflect movement away from the pole.
The dρ/ds component should also have a sign consistent with an outward path on an expanding dome (likely positive if dz/ds becomes positive). The log DEBUG: Applied corrected meridional reversal - dρ/ds=0.000000 dz/ds=0.000000 for the start of the outgoing transition needs to evolve correctly through this zone.
Debugging Request for this fix:

The "ENHANCED TRANSITION ZONE DEBUGGING" for the outgoing transition should now show:
Correct start_alpha (90 
∘
 ) and end_alpha (e.g., ≈87.9 
∘
  or the actual target helical α).
reverse_meridional=True.
Tangent vectors for intermediate points (e.g., Point 6) and the last point (Point 11) with dz/ds having the correct positive sign and dρ/ds also having a correct positive sign (for an expanding dome).
Let's focus solely on getting this outgoing transition zone to generate points that correctly move away from the pole both axially and radially, with the winding angle smoothly changing from 90 
∘
 . Thanks!
