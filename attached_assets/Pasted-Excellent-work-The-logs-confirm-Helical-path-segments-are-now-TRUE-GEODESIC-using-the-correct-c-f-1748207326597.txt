Excellent work! The logs confirm:

Helical path segments are now TRUE GEODESIC using the correct c_for_winding.
The Incoming Transition and Circumferential Arc of the first turnaround are generated correctly, and the Z-coordinate is now perfectly continuous between them.
The turnaround sequence is adding points (48 for the first turn).
The immediate critical bug causing visual issues ("sharp changes," "wrong direction") is in the OUTGOING Transition Zone of the first turnaround.

The log shows for the Outgoing Transition:

Message: Generating outgoing transition: ρ 0.088295 → 0.090295; α transition: 90.0° → 87.9° (This implies the target end_alpha should be ~87.9°)
But inside *** ENTERING _generate_smooth_transition_zone *** for this outgoing part:
end_alpha is logged as 90.0°.
reverse_meridional is logged as False.
This results in the outgoing transition also being circumferential (Point 11: ... α=90.0° ... dz/ds=-0.000000).
Please make these specific fixes in modules/trajectories.py for the OUTGOING transition part of the SMOOTH TURNAROUND SEQUENCE:

Correct end_alpha Parameter: When calling _generate_smooth_transition_zone for the outgoing transition:
The end_alpha parameter must be the calculated true geodesic alpha for the end_rho of the outgoing transition (e.g., the ≈87.9 
∘
  corresponding to ρ=0.090295m and c 
for_winding
​
 =0.088295m). It must not be 90 
∘
 .
Correct reverse_meridional Flag:
This flag must be set to True when calling _generate_smooth_transition_zone for the outgoing transition.
Apply Reversal Correctly:
Ensure that when reverse_meridional=True is active inside _generate_smooth_transition_zone, the tangent vector components (dz/ds and dρ/ds) for all generated points correctly reflect an outward path (e.g., positive dz/ds and positive dρ/ds if moving away from the -Z pole towards the equator on an expanding dome).
Debugging Request:

Focus the log output on the first turnaround of Pass 1.
For the "ENHANCED TRANSITION ZONE DEBUGGING" of the outgoing transition:
Confirm start_alpha is 90 
∘
  and end_alpha is the correct target helical angle (e.g., ≈87.9 
∘
 ).
Confirm reverse_meridional is True.
Show tangent vectors for intermediate points (e.g., Point 0, 6, 11) demonstrating correct dz/ds (positive) and dρ/ds (positive for expanding dome).
Let's fix this outgoing transition first. This should resolve the immediate "wrong direction" after the first turn and is crucial for path smoothness.
