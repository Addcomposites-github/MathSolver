The latest debug logs show the Z-coordinate for the circumferential arc is now correctly taken from the end of the incoming transition (z=-0.222712m), and the LAST OUTGOING TRANSITION tangent has the correct positive dz/ds and dρ/ds signs. This is excellent progress on fixing a single turnaround event!

However, the overall 3D trajectory visualization still appears kinked, and as per my observation, "axis jump on one end and including wrong transition profiles are generated." The log also shows only around 145-165 total points, which seems insufficient for even one full pole-to-pole-to-pole pass, let alone multiple circuits.

The key issues seem to be:

Incomplete Multi-Pass Logic: The system might be correctly executing the 3-part turnaround sequence once, but not correctly stringing together multiple pole-to-pole passes with turnarounds at both ends.
Consistency of Fixes: The Z-continuity fix and the outgoing tangent direction logic needs to be verified for turnaround events happening at both polar regions of the vessel. An "axis jump on one end" suggests one turn might be correct while the other is still using an old Z-reference.
Smoothness of Transition Zones Themselves: Even if end tangents are correct, the path shape within the 11-12 point transition zones might still be too linear.
Please adjust the main trajectory generation logic in modules/trajectories.py to address this:

Full Multi-Pass Implementation:

Ensure the code generates points for the specified number_of_passes. Each pass should consist of:
Helical segment (pole A to pole B).
Full 3-part turnaround sequence at pole B (incoming transition, circumferential arc with pattern Δϕ advance, outgoing transition).
Helical segment (pole B back to pole A).
Full 3-part turnaround sequence at pole A (incoming transition, circumferential arc with pattern Δϕ advance, outgoing transition).
...and so on.
The total number of points generated should reflect this (e.g., for 2 passes, it should be roughly double the points of a single pole-to-pole-to-pole journey plus turnaround points).
Consistent Z-Coordinate for Circumferential Arcs at BOTH Poles:

When a turnaround occurs (at either pole), the Z-coordinate for the circumferential arc segment must be the Z-coordinate of the vessel profile at that specific pole's ρ=c 
for_winding
​
  (i.e., the Z of the last point of the incoming transition zone for that specific turn). Verify this is handled correctly for turns at both ends of the vessel.
Review Point Generation within Transition Zones for Curvature:

Currently, winding angle α is interpolated using a quintic polynomial. How are the actual (ρ,z,ϕ) points within the 12-point transition zones derived from this interpolated α?
If these points are simply projected linearly based on the changing α, the zone itself might be too straight.
(Self-correction/guidance for me to provide you later if needed): To make these transition zones truly curved, the point generation should aim for a smooth change in path curvature, not just α. This might involve ensuring the second derivative of the path is also continuous or by modeling the transition as a specific curve type (e.g., a part of a spiral or a curve with varying radius of curvature that smoothly connects the helical segment to the circumferential arc). For now, let's ensure points are being generated reasonably based on the interpolated α and that the overall multi-pass logic is sound.
Debugging Request:

Please provide a log that explicitly states:
The pass_number being generated.
For each turnaround within each pass:
The Z-coordinate used for its circumferential arc.
The LAST INCOMING TRANSITION point (position & tangent).
The LAST OUTGOING TRANSITION point (position & tangent).
Crucially, please ensure the "INTERFACE TANGENT DEBUGGING" output now shows data for at least two consecutive turnaround events (e.g., one at the -Z pole and the next at the +Z pole) to verify consistency.
Please print ALL generated trajectory points (cylindrical and Cartesian, including α and pass number for each point) to a separate downloadable file or a very large, scrollable section in the UI for detailed offline analysis. The current ~150 points are insufficient for a full multi-pass trajectory.
Let's focus on getting the full multi-pass structure correct with consistent Z-handling at both poles first. Then we can further refine the visual smoothness of the transition zones if needed. And please keep the agent responses focused on the changes and the log data. Thanks!
