The focus shifts to making the "Winding Angle" the primary driver for determining the trajectory type and necessary physics, with the UI providing clear feedback and prompting for additional information (like friction coefficient) only when needed.

Here's how we can structure the implementation plan based on this approach:

Refined Plan for UI Guidance in Layer Stack Definition
Core Idea: The user primarily inputs their desired "Winding Angle." The system then classifies the likely winding type (Hoop, Helical, Polar-like), suggests the most appropriate physics model, and prompts for further parameters (like friction) if the desired angle/path is non-geodesic or requires specific conditions.

1. Modify create_advanced_layer_definition_ui in app.py:

"Layer Properties" Tab:

The "Winding Angle (°)" st.number_input becomes the central input for path definition.
The "Layer Type" st.selectbox (["helical", "hoop", "polar"]) can be:
Option A (Recommended for Simplicity): Removed entirely. The system will classify the type based on the angle.
Option B (If explicit type is still desired for other reasons): Kept, but its selection could influence the interpretation or default behavior for a given angle (e.g., a 15° angle might be treated as "Polar" if layer type "Polar" is selected, or "Low-Angle Helical" if "Helical" is selected). However, the physics will still largely be dictated by the angle. For this plan, let's lean towards simplifying by removing it or making it secondary.
Add a new display area (e.g., using st.container() with st.markdown or st.info) directly below the "Winding Angle" input to show:
Classified Winding Type: (e.g., "Path classified as: Hoop-like")
Recommended Physics Model: (e.g., "Recommended physics: Constant Angle")
Path Characteristics: (e.g., "This will be a circumferential winding.")
Feasibility Notes/Warnings: (e.g., "Note: Ensure band width allows for 90° placement.")
"Winding Physics" Tab:

The "Physics Model" st.selectbox (["clairaut", "friction", "constant_angle"]) should:
Have its index dynamically set to the recommended physics model based on the angle.
The user can still override this, but clear warnings should appear if they choose a non-optimal or incompatible model.
The "Friction Coefficient" st.slider should only be visible and active if the selected or recommended physics model is "friction".
2. Implement Backend Logic for Classification and Guidance (in app.py or a helper module):

get_winding_guidance(winding_angle_deg, vessel_geometry_context=None) function:
Input: winding_angle_deg (float), vessel_geometry_context (optional, for advanced checks like polar opening clearance).

Output: A dictionary containing:

classified_type: (str) e.g., "Hoop", "Polar/Low-Angle Helical", "Mid-Angle Helical", "High-Angle Helical".
recommended_physics_model: (str) e.g., "Constant Angle", "Clairaut", "Friction".
requires_friction_prompt: (bool) True if "Friction" is recommended or necessary.
guidance_message: (str) A user-friendly message explaining the classification and recommendation.
feasibility_notes: (list of str) Any warnings or specific considerations (e.g., "This angle is typically geodesic.").
ui_friction_coefficient_default: (float) A sensible default if friction is prompted.
Internal Logic of get_winding_guidance:

Hoop Classification (e.g., angle > 85°):
classified_type: "Hoop"
recommended_physics_model: "Constant Angle"
requires_friction_prompt: False
guidance_message: "This angle will be treated as a Hoop layer. 'Constant Angle' physics is recommended to maintain the angle precisely across the surface."
feasibility_notes: ["Ensure band width and machine kinematics support 90° placement."]
Polar / Low-Angle Helical Classification (e.g., angle < 20°):
classified_type: "Polar / Low-Angle Helical"
recommended_physics_model: "Clairaut"
requires_friction_prompt: False
guidance_message: "This low angle is typical for Polar windings or low-angle Helical layers. 'Clairaut' (geodesic) physics is recommended for a stable, natural path over the domes."
feasibility_notes: ["Path will naturally go towards/over poles.", "Consider polar opening size relative to band width."]
Mid-Angle Helical Classification (e.g., 20° to 55°-60°):
classified_type: "Mid-Angle Helical"
recommended_physics_model: "Clairaut" (as the default natural path)
requires_friction_prompt: False (initially)
guidance_message: "This angle is suitable for Helical layers. 'Clairaut' (geodesic) physics is often applicable. If this path cannot be naturally maintained or significant slippage is a concern, 'Friction' physics might be required."
feasibility_notes: []
High-Angle Helical Classification (e.g., > 55°-60° and <= 85°):
classified_type: "High-Angle Helical"
recommended_physics_model: "Friction" (as these are harder to maintain geodesically)
requires_friction_prompt: True
guidance_message: "This higher angle for a Helical layer often requires 'Friction' physics to achieve and maintain the path without slippage. Please set a friction coefficient."
feasibility_notes: ["Geodesic paths at this angle might result in a different effective angle.", "Consider 'Constant Angle' if strict angle adherence is critical and feasible."]
Edge Cases (0° or 90° exactly):
Provide specific warnings: e.g., "0° is purely axial and not a typical winding path." "90° is a pure Hoop winding; the system will optimize band placement."
3. Reactive UI Updates in create_advanced_layer_definition_ui:

On "Winding Angle" Change:

Retrieve the new winding_angle_deg from layer_config.
Call guidance = get_winding_guidance(winding_angle_deg).
Update the dedicated display area with guidance['classified_type'], guidance['recommended_physics_model'], and guidance['guidance_message'].
Update the index of the "Physics Model" st.selectbox to guidance['recommended_physics_model'].
Set a session state variable or directly control the visibility of the "Friction Coefficient" slider based on guidance['requires_friction_prompt'].
Display guidance['feasibility_notes'] as appropriate warnings or info messages.
On "Physics Model" Change (User Override):

Retrieve the user's chosen physics_model.
Call validate_algorithm_combination(classified_layer_type_from_angle, chosen_physics_model, winding_angle_deg).
Call validate_physics_compatibility(chosen_physics_model, winding_angle_deg, current_friction_coeff).
Display prominent warnings if the override is not recommended or potentially problematic for the given angle (e.g., st.warning("You've chosen '{chosen_physics_model}' which may not be optimal for {winding_angle_deg}°. The recommended model was '{recommended_model}'. Proceed with caution.")).
Update the visibility of the "Friction Coefficient" slider: show if chosen_physics_model == 'friction', hide otherwise.
4. Storing Configuration:

The layer_config dictionary passed to manager.add_layer() will now contain:
winding_angle: The user's primary input.
physics_model: The actually selected physics model (either system-recommended or user-overridden).
friction_coefficient: The value from the slider if "friction" physics is used (otherwise it can be None or 0.0).
The layer_type might be implicitly stored based on the classification or explicitly if that UI element is retained.
Benefits of this Refined Approach:

User-Centric: Focuses on the most intuitive parameter for the user (winding angle).
Intelligent Guidance: The system provides expert suggestions, reducing guesswork.
Reduced Errors: Proactive feedback prevents users from selecting invalid or problematic combinations.
Dynamic UI: The interface adapts to user choices, only showing relevant parameters like the friction coefficient when necessary.
Educational: Helps users understand the relationship between winding angle, path types, and the underlying physics.
This approach provides the clear picture and guidance you're looking for at the UI level, empowering the user while leveraging the system's backend knowledge to ensure more robust and successful trajectory planning.
