Thank you for the continued efforts. Analyzing the latest logs for the trajectory generation in modules/trajectories.py, we've identified several critical issues preventing the generation of a correct, multi-pass geodesic circuit:

Incorrect Alpha Calculation for Helical Segments:

The debug logs for Pass 1 (e.g., Processing point 105: ρ=0.089431m ... Calculated alpha=0.4657...) and Pass 2 show that Calculated alpha is not geodesic. It does not satisfy Clairaut's Law (α=arcsin(c 
for_winding
​
 /ρ)) using the target c_for_winding (e.g., 0.089101m for the 63° target angle).
Please Fix: Ensure that for every point (ρ 
i
​
 ,z 
i
​
 ) along a helical segment (between turnarounds), the winding angle α 
i
​
  is strictly calculated as α 
i
​
 =arcsin(c 
for_winding
​
 /ρ 
i
​
 ). This is fundamental.
Turnaround Sequence Adds Zero Points:

The log shows === SMOOTH TURNAROUND COMPLETE === followed by Total new points added: 0 for both Pass 1 and Pass 2 turnarounds.
This means the functions _generate_smooth_transition_zone (incoming/outgoing) and _generate_polar_turnaround_segment, despite being triggered, are not contributing any points to the trajectory.
Please Fix: Investigate these three functions to ensure they are correctly generating their list of points (12 for each transition, 36 for the arc) and that these lists are being properly appended to the main all_trajectory_points list. We need to see the "Added X incoming/circumferential/outgoing transition points" messages from previous successful logs again.
Inconsistent c_for_winding at Second Turnaround:

The log shows that for the turnaround after Pass 2, c_for_winding incorrectly becomes 0.038677m (the physical c 
eff
​
 ) instead of the target Clairaut's constant (e.g., 0.089101m).
Please Fix: Ensure the target c_for_winding (derived from the user's target cylinder angle) is used consistently for determining the turnaround radius for all turnaround events within the specified number of passes.
Flawed Multi-Pass Structure / "Array" Behavior:

The current sequence (Pass 1 helical -> 0-point turn -> Pass 2 helical with wrong c_for_winding -> 0-point turn -> separate "RETURN HELICAL PATH") is not a correct multi-pass structure.
Please Refactor: A single "pass" should typically involve a journey from a starting pole, a turnaround at the other pole, a return journey to the starting pole, and a final turnaround at the starting pole (which includes the main pattern advancement ΔΦ 
total
​
  to set up for the next pass).
Ensure the target_passes variable controls the number of these complete circuits.
The logic for "Direction: Forward" and "Direction: Reverse" needs to be part of a cohesive loop for each pass.
Debugging Request for this Iteration:

For the first pass (one forward helical leg, one full 3-part turnaround, one return helical leg, one full 3-part turnaround):
Log the Calculated alpha for several points along both helical legs to verify Clairaut's Law.
Confirm that the "INTERFACE TANGENT DEBUGGING" shows continuity and that the Z-coordinate for the circumferential arc is correct (taken from the end of its incoming transition).
Crucially, log the "Total new points added" by each call to the 3-part turnaround sequence – this should be around 59-60 points (e.g., 12+36+12).
Log the total number of points after completing ONE full pass.
Let's prioritize fixing: 1. Geodesic Alpha, 2. Turnaround Point Generation, 3. Consistent c_for_winding. The multi-pass structure can be refined once these fundamentals are solid for a single complete circuit. If the UI still shows no profile, please confirm that all_trajectory_points is being populated and passed to the UI correctly.

To simplify debugging and reduce log noise, please temporarily disable or comment out the "DEBUG Pass X: Processing point Y..." for every single point in the helical segments once we confirm alpha is generally correct, and only keep the interface/summary logs. You can also remove the many _get_slope_dz_drho_at_rho logs for now.
