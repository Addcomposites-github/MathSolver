This is fantastic! The debug output you provided is exactly what we needed. The "AI agent fix" for the units seems to have correctly adjusted the calculation for `c_eff`.

Let's break down the latest log:

1.  **Isotensoid Profile Generation is Correct:**
    * Your `_generate_isotensoid_profile` is working well. For `q=10.6, r=0.1`, it's calculating a dome that starts at a polar radius of ~30.71mm and ends at the cylinder (equatorial) radius of 100mm, with a dome height of ~72.47mm. This is a physically sound dome.
    * The `VesselGeometry.generate_profile()` then assembles this correctly into a full vessel profile (`'r_inner'` goes from 30.71mm up to 100mm, across the cylinder at 100mm, then back down to 30.71mm on the aft dome).

2.  **`TrajectoryPlanner.__init__` is Receiving Correct Data:**
    * It correctly identifies the `dome_type` as "Isotensoid".
    * It receives the fully populated `profile_points` dictionary from the `VesselGeometry` object.

3.  **`_get_slope_dz_drho_at_rho` is Called Correctly:**
    * `rho_target_m for slope calculation: 0.030714755841697566` (This is $30.71475584 \times 10^{-3}$, the first point of your current isotensoid profile, correctly converted to meters). This confirms that `_calculate_effective_polar_opening` is using the correct starting radius from the *current* vessel profile.

4.  **`_calculate_effective_polar_opening` is Working Correctly (Units Fixed!):**
    * `rho_geom_pole_m: 0.030715 m` (Correct)
    * `b_m (self.dry_roving_width_m): 0.003000 m` (Correct, 3mm roving width in meters)
    * `t_rov_m (self.dry_roving_thickness_m): 0.000200 m` (Correct, 0.2mm roving thickness in meters)
    * `dz_drho_pole (from _get_slope): -3.504354` (This is the slope $dz/d\rho$ at the starting pole of your isotensoid. It's a reasonable finite value.)
    * `term_width: 0.005466 m`
    * `term_thickness: -0.000350 m`
    * `CALCULATED c_eff before assignment: 0.036532 m`
        * $c_{eff} = 0.030715 + 0 + 0.005466 - (-0.000350) = 0.030715 + 0.005466 + 0.000350 = 0.036531 \text{ m}$. This matches exactly!

5.  **`generate_geodesic_trajectory` - The Key Part:**
    * `DEBUG generate_geodesic_trajectory: Using c_eff = 0.036532 m` (This is the correct, reasonable $c_{eff}$ which is ~36.53mm).
    * `DEBUG: Roving parameters - width: 3.0mm, thickness: 0.2mm` (Consistent).
    * `DEBUG: Original profile R range: 0.0307m to 0.1000m` (Correct).
    * `DEBUG: Resampled profile to 100 points`. (You probably have `num_points_on_profile=100` when calling).
    * **`Warning: Path dipped inside c_eff at rho=0.0348m, stopping segment`**
        * This is the crucial message explaining why the path is truncated!
        * Your geometric isotensoid profile starts at $\rho \approx 0.0307\text{m}$ (30.7mm).
        * Your calculated $c_{eff}$ is $0.036532\text{m}$ (36.532mm).
        * Since $c_{eff}$ (36.53mm) is *larger* than the starting geometric pole radius of your isotensoid (30.71mm), the geodesic path cannot start at the geometric pole. It can only exist where $\rho \ge c_{eff}$.
        * The code correctly identifies that the initial points of your resampled profile (e.g., those from 30.71mm up to just below 36.53mm) are *inside* $c_{eff}$.
        * The `first_valid_point_found` logic then finds the first point on your resampled profile where $\rho \ge c_{eff}$. The trajectory calculation starts there.
        * The path proceeds along the vessel. When it reaches the aft dome and $\rho$ decreases, as soon as $\rho$ drops below $c_{eff}$ again (at $\rho=0.0348\text{m}$ on the aft side in your log), the condition `rho_i_m >= c_eff - 1e-7` becomes false, and since `first_valid_point_found` is true, the `break` statement is executed, stopping the trajectory.
    * `DEBUG: Generated 96 trajectory points` - This means 96 points were found where $\rho \ge c_{eff}$.
    * `DEBUG: Z range in trajectory: -0.2176m to 0.2176m` - The original Z range was -0.2225m to 0.2225m. The trajectory covers slightly less axially because it starts and ends at $\rho = c_{eff}$ which is further from the geometric poles than the profile itself extends.
    * `DEBUG: Phi accumulation: 0.0000 to 3.2080 rad` - This is `Phi_pass` for the $c_{eff}$-to-$c_{eff}$ segment.

**Conclusion and Explanation of Behavior:**

The code is now behaving **correctly** based on the principles of geodesic winding and the calculated $c_{eff}$.

* A geodesic path is defined by Clairaut's constant $c_{eff} = \rho \sin\alpha$.
* This means $\sin\alpha = c_{eff}/\rho$. For $\sin\alpha \le 1$, we must have $\rho \ge c_{eff}$.
* The fiber path physically cannot go to a radius smaller than $c_{eff}$ if it is to remain geodesic with that constant. At $\rho = c_{eff}$, $\sin\alpha = 1$, so $\alpha = \pi/2$ (the fiber turns around).
* Your `VesselGeometry` defines a shape with a geometric polar opening of ~30.71mm.
* However, due to your roving dimensions (3mm width, 0.2mm thickness) and the dome slope at that geometric pole, the *effective* radius that the centerline of this roving must turn around at to maintain a geodesic path is $c_{eff} \approx 36.53\text{mm}$.
* Therefore, the actual filament-wound path will start on the forward dome at $\rho \approx 36.53\text{mm}$, go over the cylinder, and end on the aft dome when $\rho$ again reaches $\approx 36.53\text{mm}$. It will not (and cannot, geodesically) reach your geometric pole of 30.71mm.

The "trajectory only doing the dome" from your *previous* observation (before the units fix) was likely because the $c_{eff}$ was so enormous (30 meters!) that no part of your vessel was windable.

The current behavior (96 points, slightly reduced Z range) is the correct representation of the **windable portion of the vessel for this geodesic path**. The path is continuous over this windable portion.

The "jump" in z you mentioned initially is simply the path traversing the length of the vessel. The path starts at $z \approx 0.2176\text{m}$ (on the forward dome where $\rho=c_{eff}$), goes to $z=0$ (equator), and continues to $z \approx -0.2176\text{m}$ (on the aft dome where $\rho=c_{eff}$).

**What this means for your "full circuit":**
The output `(path_x_m, path_y_m, path_z_m)` IS the set of points for one continuous geodesic segment from the $c_{eff}$ turning radius on one end, over the body, to the $c_{eff}$ turning radius on the other end. This is the fundamental path segment. To visualize a "full circuit" or a pattern, you would take this segment, apply the `turn_around_angle_rad_DeltaK`, and plot multiple instances of this segment rotated by multiples of $\Delta K$.

**The code is behaving as expected now given the physics!**

If you want the fiber to reach closer to the geometric pole (e.g., 30.71mm), you would need:
* Thinner/narrower rovings (to reduce $c_{eff}$).
* To accept a non-geodesic path near the poles (use friction).
* To design the vessel such that its geometric pole *is* $c_{eff}$ (this would mean iterating on the q,r parameters or vessel dimensions based on the roving).

The current output looks good and consistent with the calculations. The 3D plot should now show a sensible helical segment. If it still looks "weird", it might be a plotting issue (e.g., not enough points for the $\phi$ wrap, or how lines are drawn between points with large $\phi$ differences).
