This is excellent progress, and the detailed logs are extremely valuable! The Replit agent has correctly fixed the control flow, and the turnaround sequence (incoming transition, circumferential arc, outgoing transition) is now being called.

Let's analyze the new debug output and your observation: "looks very bad as multiple circle segments try to connect, seems wrong direction."

Analysis of the New Console Log:

Correct c_eff and Target Angle Handling:

CALCULATED c_eff before assignment: 0.038677 m (physical minimum).
Using Clairaut's constant c = 0.090631 m (for the 65° target angle).
This confirms the system is using the correct Clairaut's constant for the helical path, which defines the radius at which the turn should occur.
Turnaround Sequence Triggered:

DEBUG: *** POLAR OPENING DETECTED *** at ρ=0.090711, c_for_winding=0.090631, diff=0.00008036
DEBUG: *** ENTERING SMOOTH TURNAROUND SEQUENCE ***
This is a major step forward! The logic to actually enter the turnaround sequence is now working.
Incoming Transition Zone:

Generating incoming transition: ρ 0.091067 → 0.090631
α transition: 25.1° → 90.0°
The numerous calls to _get_slope_dz_drho_at_rho within this phase suggest points are being calculated along this transition.
Added 5 incoming transition points
This seems to be functioning as intended: smoothly changing α to 90° as ρ approaches c_for_winding.
Circumferential Turnaround Segment:

Generating circumferential turnaround at ρ=0.090631
The "TURNAROUND SEGMENT DEBUG" shows the 24 points are generated at a constant ρ and z, with ϕ progressing by 45°. The tangents are correctly circumferential. This part appears to be working correctly in isolation.
Added 24 circumferential turnaround points
Outgoing Transition Zone:

Generating outgoing transition: ρ 0.090631 → 0.092631
α transition: 90.0° → 25.1° (The target end α of 25.1° here is the same as the start of the incoming transition, which is correct for a symmetric turnaround if the vessel profile is symmetric around the pole).
The calls to _get_slope_dz_drho_at_rho again indicate point generation.
Added 6 outgoing transition points
Overall Path:

The log doesn't show the "Warning: Path dipped inside c_for_winding" during the main helical segment calculation before the first turn, which means the detection and hand-off to the turnaround sequence is now happening before the main loop terminates prematurely.
The "Warning: Path dipped inside c_for_winding at rho=0.0906m, stopping segment" after the turnaround sequence (SMOOTH TURNAROUND COMPLETE) and the generation of only 100 total points with limited Z range and Phi accumulation from the previous log seems to have been superseded by the new successful completion of the turnaround sequence, though the final point count in this log isn't explicitly stated for the entire first pass including the turn.
Interpreting "looks very bad as multiple circle segments try to connect, seems wrong direction":

Given that the individual components (incoming transition, circumferential arc, outgoing transition) seem to be generating points with the intended characteristics (α changes, ρ and z constant for arc), your observation is likely pointing to issues in how these segments are connected or how their tangent vectors are ultimately aligning in 3D space, especially concerning the direction of ϕ accumulation or the direction of the meridional reversal.

"Multiple circle segments try to connect": This could mean the transitions themselves, or the connection between the transitions and the main helical path, are not as smooth as expected, creating an appearance of distinct segments rather than one flowing curve.
"Seems wrong direction": This is a critical clue. It could imply:
Handedness of ϕ change: Is the Δϕ 
pattern
​
  in the circumferential segment being added/subtracted correctly to make the overall path flow naturally, or is it causing the path to try and "turn back on itself" in the ϕ direction before reversing meridionally?
Meridional Reversal: How is the dz/ds component of the tangent vector reversed after the turn? If the outgoing transition starts with dz/ds in the same direction as the incoming path, it won't actually be a "turnaround" in the Z-axis. The winding angle α smoothly going X→90 
∘
 →X is correct, but the direction of travel along the meridian must flip.
The calculation of the tangent vector for the outgoing path needs to ensure that while α has the same magnitude as the incoming path (for a symmetric profile), the sign of the meridional velocity component (dz/ds or dρ/ds depending on parametrization) is reversed.
Next Prompt for the Replit Agent:

The agent has made excellent progress in triggering the sequence. Now the focus needs to be on the precise geometric continuity and directional logic between these segments.

"Hi Replit Agent,

The good news is that the debug logs confirm the full turnaround sequence (incoming transition, circumferential arc, outgoing transition) is now being called and each segment appears to be generating its points with the intended characteristics (e.g., α transitions, constant ρ,z for the arc).

However, the visual result in the 3D plot "looks very bad as multiple circle segments try to connect, seems wrong direction." This suggests that while the segments are generated, their connection and the overall directional flow of the path through the turnaround are not yet correct, leading to a lack of true smoothness.

Please investigate the following in modules/trajectories.py:

Direction of Meridional Reversal:

When transitioning from the "incoming transition zone" to the "circumferential turnaround arc" and then to the "outgoing transition zone," how is the direction of travel along the vessel's meridian (e.g., the sign of dz/ds or dρ/ds) being managed?
For a proper turnaround, the meridional component of the tangent vector for the outgoing path must be opposite to that of the incoming path. Please verify that the calculations for the start of the "outgoing transition zone" and the subsequent helical path correctly reflect this reversal.
ϕ (Parallel Angle) Accumulation and Direction during Turnaround:

The circumferential arc correctly applies a delta_phi_pattern. Is the starting ϕ for the outgoing transition zone (and thus the next helical segment) correctly based on the ending ϕ of this circumferential arc?
Could the "wrong direction" observation be related to how ϕ is advanced relative to the reversal of the meridional direction, potentially causing the path to appear to twist incorrectly?
Tangent Vector Continuity at Segment Interfaces (Re-Verification):

Although the segments are now generated, please add very specific debug output to log and compare the full 3D tangent vectors (e.g., [dx/ds,dy/ds,dz/ds]) at these precise interfaces:
Last point of incoming helical path vs. First point of incoming transition zone.
Last point of incoming transition zone vs. First point of circumferential arc.
Last point of circumferential arc vs. First point of outgoing transition zone.
Last point of outgoing transition zone vs. First point of outgoing helical path.
We need to ensure these vectors are not just positionally connected but are collinear (or smoothly transitioning if a curve is joining another curve tangentially).
Point Generation within Transition Zones:

The agent mentioned "cubic Hermite spline interpolation using the smoothstep function (3t 
2
 −2t 
3
 )" for α. How are the path points (ρ,z,ϕ) themselves calculated within these transition zones based on this interpolated α? Is it possible that the step size or integration method here is leading to an insufficiently smooth curve despite a smooth α profile?
The aim is a visually smooth 3D path where the fiber appears to naturally and continuously change direction at the poles without any sharp angles or unnatural twists. The "seems wrong direction" comment is particularly important to address.
