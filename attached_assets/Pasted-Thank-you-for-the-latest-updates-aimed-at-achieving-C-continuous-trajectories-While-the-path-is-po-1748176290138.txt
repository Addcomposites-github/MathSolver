Thank you for the latest updates aimed at achieving C¹ continuous trajectories. While the path is positionally connected, the visual output in the 3D plot still shows a 'kink' or sharp directional change at the polar turnaround points, rather than a smoothly blended curve. It appears the segment at the pole is still behaving like a straight line joined to the helical paths, leading to a tangent discontinuity.

Could you please re-examine the implementation in modules/trajectories.py, specifically:

The _generate_polar_turnaround_segment method:

How are the points within this segment currently generated? Is it creating a series of points along a smooth arc (e.g., a segment of a circle of radius c 
eff
​
  in the plane of the polar opening), or is it a simpler representation?
How many points are typically generated for this turnaround segment? A true curve would require multiple intermediate points.
Tangent Vector Matching at Connection Points:

Please detail how the tangent vector of the last calculated point of an incoming helical pass is being used to determine the starting conditions (position and tangent) of the first point of the _generate_polar_turnaround_segment.
Similarly, how is the tangent vector of the last point of the _generate_polar_turnaround_segment used to determine the starting conditions for the first point of the outgoing (reversed) helical pass?
Are you explicitly calculating and matching the derivatives dρ/ds, dz/ds, and dϕ/ds (or their Cartesian equivalents dx/ds,dy/ds,dz/ds) at these interface points? (Referencing concepts from Koussios Thesis, Ch. 2, Eq. 2.19 for tangent vectors).
Integration of Winding Angle (α) Transition:

The agent mentioned "enhanced winding angle transitions using cubic spline interpolation." How is this interpolated α (as it approaches and leaves 90 
∘
 ) being used to generate the path points in the immediate vicinity of the c 
eff
​
  radius, leading into and out of the purely circumferential (α=90 
∘
 ) segment? A smooth change in α should lead to a smooth change in path direction.
Review the "3D curve modeling with slight Z-variation":

Could this "slight Z-variation" be masking a more fundamental 2D path discontinuity on the mandrel surface? For a geodesic turn at a constant radius c 
eff
​
  (if c 
eff
​
  is at a flat polar face), Z should ideally remain constant during the purely circumferential part of the turn.
The goal is to ensure the generated path has a continuous first derivative (C 
1
  continuity) throughout the entire multi-pass trajectory, especially at the polar turnarounds. The 3D plot should visually confirm this with a path that flows smoothly without any abrupt kinks.
