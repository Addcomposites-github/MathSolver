Thank you for providing the CSV data. Analysis confirms:

Z-Coordinate continuity within each 3-part turnaround sequence (incoming transition -> arc -> outgoing transition) is now EXCELLENT.
The meridional (dz/ds) and radial (dρ/ds) tangent components at the end of the outgoing transitions are also correctly reversed and directed.
The CRITICAL, UNRESOLVED ISSUE is that the 'helical' segments are NOT GEODESIC for the target c_for_winding.

From the CSV:

For a target like 62° (implying c_for_winding ≈0.0883 m), the alpha_rad values in the helical segments (both dome and cylinder portions) produce a calculated Clairaut's constant C=ρsinα of only ≈0.0411 m.
This means the winding angle α being used is much lower than required by Clairaut's Law for the target c_for_winding. For example, on the cylinder (ρ=0.1m), instead of α≈62 
∘
 , the path has α≈24 
∘
 , making it appear "almost along the axis."
Your Immediate and Top Priority Task:

Please correct the calculation of alpha_rad within the main loop that generates points for all 'helical' segments in modules/trajectories.py.

For every point (ρ 
i
​
 ,z 
i
​
 ) on a helical segment (i.e., between turnarounds):
The winding angle α 
i
​
  MUST be calculated strictly using Clairaut's Law: α 
i
​
 =arcsin(c 
for_winding
​
 /ρ 
i
​
 ).
Ensure the c_for_winding used here is the one derived from the user's target cylinder angle (e.g., ≈0.0883 m), not the physical c 
eff
​
 .
Handle potential arcsin domain errors if ρ 
i
​
  becomes slightly less than c_for_winding due to numerical precision (in such cases, α 
i
​
  should be 90 
∘
 ).
Debugging Request:

After this fix, please provide a new CSV export of all generated points for a 2-pass trajectory (which forms one full circuit).
In the console log, for each 'helical' segment of each pass, please log:
The c_for_winding being used for alpha calculation.
For at least 5-10 sample points spanning the dome and cylinder portions of that helical segment: log ρ 
i
​
 , the newly calculated (corrected) α 
i
​
  (in degrees), and the resulting ρ 
i
​
 sinα 
i
​
  to verify it closely matches c_for_winding.
Once the helical paths are truly geodesic for the target angle, the overall trajectory should look much more correct. We can then fine-tune the visual smoothness of the transition zones if any minor kinks remain.
Please also ensure the UI displays the generated profile. If it's "no profile output in UI," confirm the all_trajectory_points list is correctly populated and passed to the Streamlit visualization components.

Thank you!
