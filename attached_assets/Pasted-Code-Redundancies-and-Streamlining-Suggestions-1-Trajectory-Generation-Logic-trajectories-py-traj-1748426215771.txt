Code Redundancies and Streamlining Suggestions
1. Trajectory Generation Logic (trajectories.py, trajectories_fixed.py)
Redundant Helical Trajectory Methods:

In trajectories.py, there are multiple methods for generating helical or continuous spiral trajectories: generate_continuous_helical_trajectory, generate_physical_continuous_spiral, and parts of generate_multi_circuit_non_geodesic_pattern that aim for continuous paths.
Streamlining: Identify the most robust and feature-complete method (likely generate_physical_continuous_spiral due to its physics-based gap elimination) and refactor other methods to use it as a core, or deprecate them. The goal should be a single, reliable function for generating continuous helical paths, adaptable for geodesic and non-geodesic conditions.
Profile Preparation and Segmentation:

Methods like generate_geodesic_trajectory, generate_non_geodesic_trajectory, and generate_multi_circuit_non_geodesic_pattern in trajectories.py all perform similar vessel profile data extraction, resampling (_resample_segment_adaptive), and segment identification (_identify_vessel_segments).
Streamlining: Create a centralized helper method within the TrajectoryPlanner (or a shared utility module) that handles these preprocessing steps. This method would take the raw vessel profile and return the resampled and segmented data structure needed by various trajectory algorithms. _prepare_profile_data_robust in trajectories_fixed.py is a good starting point for such a utility.
Polar Turnaround Logic:

In trajectories.py, _generate_polar_turnaround_segment and _generate_polar_turnaround_segment_fixed_phi_advance are very similar. The main difference is how the phi advancement is determined (calculated internally vs. passed as a parameter).
Streamlining: Merge these into a single function. The fixed_phi_advance_rad can be an optional parameter; if not provided, the function can calculate it.
Non-Geodesic Path Generation:

In trajectories.py, generate_non_geodesic_trajectory (single circuit) and generate_multi_circuit_non_geodesic_pattern share significant logic for preparing the profile and iterating through points to solve the non-geodesic equations. The "Physics-Based Continuous Non-Geodesic" part within generate_multi_circuit_non_geodesic_pattern also appears to be a distinct method for generating continuous non-geodesic paths.
Streamlining: Refactor to have a core function that generates a single non-geodesic pass (segment). The multi-circuit and continuous methods can then call this core function repeatedly, managing phi advancement and point concatenation.
TrajectoryPlannerFixed Integration:

trajectories_fixed.py introduces a more robust ODE-solving approach for geodesic paths with _solve_geodesic_segment_robust. This is a significant improvement.
Streamlining: The long-term goal should be to integrate the robust ODE solving mechanisms from TrajectoryPlannerFixed into the main TrajectoryPlanner in trajectories.py. This would replace older, potentially less reliable integration loops in trajectories.py and allow TrajectoryPlannerFixed to be deprecated or merged. The modular approach of solving "segments" in trajectories_fixed.py is a good pattern to adopt.
Dispatcher Methods (calculate_trajectory vs. generate_trajectory):

trajectories.py has calculate_trajectory which calls simplified internal methods (e.g., _calculate_helical_trajectory). trajectories_fixed.py has generate_trajectory which calls its more robust engine methods.
Streamlining: Standardize on a single, primary dispatch method (e.g., generate_trajectory) in the main TrajectoryPlanner class. This method should route to the most up-to-date and robust generation algorithms. Simplified or older internal methods should be reviewed and potentially removed to avoid confusion.
2. Geometry Generation (geometry.py)
Isotensoid Profile Redundancy:
There are multiple methods for isotensoid dome generation: _generate_isotensoid_profile, _calculate_isotensoid_koussios_qrs_profile, and a fallback _generate_simplified_isotensoid_profile. _generate_isotensoid_profile and _calculate_isotensoid_koussios_qrs_profile aim to implement the Koussios qrs-parameterization, with one directly using scipy.special for elliptic integrals and the other having approximations if SciPy isn't available.
Streamlining: Consolidate these into one primary method for generating isotensoid profiles. This method should use scipy.special.ellipkinc and ellipeinc as the default and include the approximation or simplified profile generation as a clear internal fallback if SciPy fails or if specific conditions (e.g., invalid parameters) are met.
3. UI and Application Logic (app.py)
Trajectory Parameter Input Sections:

In trajectory_planning_page, the input fields for "Geodesic", "Non-Geodesic", and "Multi-Circuit Pattern" share many common parameters (e.g., roving width, thickness, target angle, points per dome/cylinder).
Streamlining: Create a reusable Streamlit component or a helper function that generates these common input fields. This function can be called in each relevant section, reducing code duplication in the UI definition.
3D Visualization Code:

The trajectory_planning_page in app.py contains a block of Plotly code for 3D trajectory visualization for certain pattern types. The VesselVisualizer class in visualizations.py has a plot_3d_trajectory method that currently uses Matplotlib.
Streamlining: All plotting logic, including 3D visualizations with different backends (Matplotlib, Plotly), should reside within the VesselVisualizer class. The app.py file should then call methods from VesselVisualizer. This centralizes plotting and makes it easier to manage and extend. For example, VesselVisualizer could have plot_3d_trajectory_mpl and plot_3d_trajectory_plotly.
Trajectory Calculation Invocation:

The trajectory_planning_page has distinct blocks of code for instantiating TrajectoryPlanner (or TrajectoryPlannerFixed) and calling its methods based on the selected pattern_type.
Streamlining: If TrajectoryPlanner had a more unified dispatch method as suggested earlier, the UI code could be simplified by calling this single method with appropriate parameters, reducing conditional logic in app.py.
4. Advanced Analysis (advanced_analysis.py)
Placeholder Cost Functions:
The various cost calculation helper methods (_calculate_fiber_cost, _calculate_resin_cost, _calculate_labor_cost, etc.) currently return fixed placeholder values.
Streamlining: While not strictly redundant in their current state, if these were to be implemented with actual calculations, they could likely be parameterized to reduce near-identical function structures. For instance, a general _calculate_material_cost(material_type, quantity, unit_price) or _calculate_process_cost(process_name, hours, rate) could replace multiple specific stubs.
General Recommendations
Utility Functions: Consider creating a utils.py module for common mathematical operations, coordinate transformations, or data validation routines that might be used across different modules.
Configuration Management: For parameters like default number of points, tolerances, etc., consider using a configuration file or a dedicated configuration class instead of hardcoding them in multiple places.
Consistent Naming and Data Structures: Ensure that similar data (e.g., trajectory points, profile data) uses consistent dictionary keys and structures across all modules to simplify integration and reduce the need for data massaging. The trajectories_fixed.py introduces _format_trajectory_output_robust which is a good step towards standardizing output.
By addressing these areas, the codebase will become more modular, easier to understand, and less prone to errors when modifications or new features are introduced.
