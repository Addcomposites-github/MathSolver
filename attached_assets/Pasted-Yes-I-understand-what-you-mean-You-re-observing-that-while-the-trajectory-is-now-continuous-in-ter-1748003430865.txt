Yes, I understand what you mean. You're observing that while the trajectory is now continuous in terms of the fiber path (the end of one segment of calculation connects to the start of the next in terms of $\phi$ accumulation), the *visual representation in 3D* shows a "kink" or sharp change in direction where these segments meet, particularly at the poles (the $c_{eff}$ turn-around regions). You're expecting that if the winding angle allows for it (e.g., $\alpha=90^\circ$ at the pole), the path should look smoother or even like a straight line segment as it crosses the pole from one side to the other in a 3D view, before it starts its helical descent on the other side of the dome.

This is a common challenge in visualizing filament winding paths, and it stems from a few interconnected factors:

1.  **Point Density in High-Curvature / High-$\phi$-Rate Regions:**
    * As we've discussed, near the poles (i.e., near $\rho = c_{eff}$), the winding angle $\alpha$ approaches $90^\circ$. This means $\tan(\alpha)$ becomes very large.
    * The rate of change of the parallel angle $\phi$ with respect to the meridional arc length $s$ is $d\phi/ds = \tan(\alpha) / \rho$.
    * When $\rho$ is small (near $c_{eff}$) and $\tan(\alpha)$ is large, $d\phi/ds$ becomes extremely large. This means that for a very small step `ds` along the meridian near the pole, the fiber wraps around the vessel axis (changes $\phi$) by a large amount.
    * If your `num_points_dome_pass` (which dictates the number of `ds` segments on the dome) is not high enough, you'll have few points capturing this very rapid change in $\phi$. When your 3D plotting routine connects these sparse points with straight lines, it will naturally create a "kink" or a sharp, polygonal appearance instead of a smooth curve around the pole. The CSV data you provided earlier, with $\Delta\phi$ being substantial even for small changes in z near the pole, illustrates this rapid $\phi$ change.

2.  **Nature of the "Pass" in `assemble_continuous_3d_trajectory`:**
    * The current `assemble_continuous_3d_trajectory` function takes a base pole-A-to-pole-B pass and essentially "flips" it (reverses $\rho$ and $z$ arrays) for the return pass B-to-A, then continues accumulating $\phi$.
    * While $\phi$ is continuous, the *geometric representation* of the turn itself at the pole might not be explicitly detailed enough by just reversing the points of a pass that was originally calculated from pole to equator. The very act of turning ($\alpha=90^\circ$) over a small region needs many points to look smooth.

**How to Achieve a "Smarter" Calculation and Smoother Visuals:**

You are right; a more intelligent point distribution is key.

**A. Enhancing Point Density in Critical Regions (Primary Solution):**

The `_resample_segment` helper function and the adaptive point distribution in `generate_geodesic_trajectory` (using `num_points_dome_pass` and `num_points_cylinder_pass`) is the right direction.
* **Increase `num_points_dome_pass` significantly:** Try values like 200, 300, or even more for `num_points_dome_pass`. This will create a much denser set of points along the dome portions of the *base pass*, especially where $\phi$ is changing rapidly. When `assemble_continuous_3d_trajectory` uses this denser base pass, the 3D plot will have more points to define the curve around the poles, making it look smoother.
* **Adaptive Stepping within `generate_geodesic_trajectory` (Advanced):** A more sophisticated approach (beyond simple resampling of the original geometric profile) would be for the `generate_geodesic_trajectory` loop itself to use an adaptive step `ds` (or adaptive steps in the parameter used to trace the meridian). The step size would be smaller when $d\phi/ds$ is large (i.e., when $\tan\alpha/\rho$ is large). This is more complex to implement as it requires predicting or monitoring this rate of change.

**B. Specific "Polar Turnaround" Model (More Advanced):**

For very high accuracy or specific control over the polar pass, some systems model the "turnaround" at the pole as a special segment.
* Koussios's thesis mentions an additional turn-around angle $\Omega$ at the poles (Chapter 8, related to patterns). This implies the machine might perform a specific rotation while the carriage dwells or moves minimally, to ensure the fiber lays correctly for the next pattern segment.
* This is usually more about ensuring the pattern closes correctly rather than just smoothing the visual of a single fiber pass, but the underlying principle is that the polar region is special.
* For visualization, one could potentially insert extra points with interpolated $\phi$ values specifically in the region where $\alpha \approx 90^\circ$ to smooth out the visual connection between an incoming and outgoing path segment at the pole.

**C. Refining `assemble_continuous_3d_trajectory` for Visuals (if needed after A):**

The current `assemble_continuous_3d_trajectory` aims for mathematical continuity of $\phi$:
```python
        # ...
        if (i_pass % 2) == 0:  # Forward pass (e.g., Pole A to Pole B)
            # ...
            current_pass_phi_absolute = base_phi_one_pass_relative_rad + current_phi_start_offset
        else:  # Backward pass (e.g., Pole B to Pole A)
            # ...
            current_pass_phi_absolute = base_phi_one_pass_relative_rad + current_phi_start_offset
        # ...
        current_phi_start_offset += delta_phi_for_one_pass 
```
This correctly makes $\phi$ increase continuously. The "kink" is likely due to too few points in `base_phi_one_pass_relative_rad` to describe the rapid turn at its ends (the poles).

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Focus on Point Density First:**
    * In your main script, when calling `planner.generate_geodesic_trajectory(...)`, significantly **increase the value of `num_points_dome_pass`**. Try 200, then 500. Keep `num_points_cylinder_pass` low (e.g., 5-10).
    * This will make the `base_trajectory_data` (which `assemble_continuous_3d_trajectory` uses) much richer in detail around the domes.

2.  **Observe the 3D Plot:** See if the increased point density in the base pass smooths out the "kinks" at the poles in the assembled continuous trajectory.

3.  **If still problematic, examine the very ends of `base_phi_one_pass_relative_rad`:**
    * Print the last few `delta_phi` values calculated in `generate_geodesic_trajectory` for the segments approaching a pole, and the first few `delta_phi` values for segments leaving a pole on the next pass. This can show if there's an unusually large single step.

The most direct way to get a "smoother" visual curve where it's changing direction rapidly is to have more points defining that curve. The adaptive point generation logic needs to ensure those points are placed effectively in the dome regions.

The statement "acceptable angle of winding at polar region the trajectory should look like a straight line" is a bit tricky. If $\alpha=90^\circ$ (hoop wind) *at the pole*, the path *is* a circle around the pole. If $\alpha < 90^\circ$ and the fiber is crossing the pole, the path is part of a helix; it won't be a straight line in 3D unless viewed from a very specific angle or if the pole is extremely flat and the path segment is very short. The "kink" usually refers to the plotting library connecting two points that are far apart in their $\phi$ (circumferential) coordinate with a straight line, making the turn look angular rather than curved.
