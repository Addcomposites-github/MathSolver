Hi Replit Agent,

Excellent work on correcting the Calculated TRUE GEODESIC alpha for the main helical segments! This is now working perfectly according to the logs.

However, the main issue preventing circuit generation is that the turnaround sequence functions are still resulting in Total new points added: 0. The log shows the '*** TRIGGERING TURNAROUND ***' message, but then === SMOOTH TURNAROUND COMPLETE === appears with no points added from the crucial transition and arc segments.

The detailed "Attempting to call..." and "Successfully entered..." logs for _generate_smooth_transition_zone (incoming/outgoing) and _generate_polar_turnaround_segment are still missing.

Your Immediate Top Priority:

Ensure Turnaround Functions Execute & Log:

Verify Function Calls: Please add (or ensure they are active and not being bypassed) distinct print("DEBUG: Attempting to call _generate_smooth_transition_zone (incoming)...") statements immediately before the call to the incoming transition function. Do the same for the circumferential arc and outgoing transition functions.
Verify Function Entry: As the very first executable line inside each of these three functions (_generate_smooth_transition_zone (differentiating between incoming and outgoing calls if it's the same function) and _generate_polar_turnaround_segment), add a clear print("DEBUG: Successfully ENTERED _generate_smooth_transition_zone (incoming)") (and similarly for the others).
If these "Successfully entered" messages do not appear after the "Attempting to call" messages, it means there's an error at the call site or an issue (like incorrect parameters or an unhandled exception) preventing the function from even starting its execution properly.
Debug Point Generation Within Turnaround Functions:

If the functions are being entered, we need to see why they aren't returning points. Please ensure the internal logging you added previously (showing point-by-point generation with coordinates, tangents, and the final list of points before returning) is active and visible for each of these three functions.
Specifically, confirm how the list of generated points from each of these sub-functions is being collected and appended to the main all_trajectory_points list.
Addressing the "No Profile Output in UI":
This is almost certainly because all_trajectory_points is incomplete due to the turnarounds failing to add their points, or an error in the process is leading to an empty/invalid list being passed to the UI.

Let's focus intently on getting those "Successfully entered..." logs for the three turnaround functions and seeing the points they generate. The "TRUE GEODESIC alpha" for the helical parts is a great foundation, now we need the turns!

For now, please keep the detailed per-point logging for the helical segments commented out to reduce log noise, so we can isolate the turnaround sequence.
