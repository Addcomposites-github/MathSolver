Thank you for implementing the changes aimed at C¹ continuity, including the explicit tangent vector calculations and the genuine circular arc for turnarounds with 24 points.

However, when I test the application, the turnaround at the poles still visually appears as a short line segment, leading to a kinked look rather than a truly smooth, flowing curve into and out of the polar region.

To help diagnose why the 24-point circular arc segment might still look like a line or why the connection still appears kinked, could you please:

Output Turnaround Segment Data:

For one specific polar turnaround event, please log the calculated coordinates (ideally both cylindrical (ρ,z,ϕ) and Cartesian (x,y,z)) of all 24 points generated by the _generate_polar_turnaround_segment method. We need to inspect these points to see if they indeed form a distinct curve.
Also, report the total angular sweep (e.g., Δϕ 
turnaround
​
 ) that this 24-point segment is designed to cover.
Verify Tangent Vectors at Interfaces (Numerically):

Please calculate and log the numerical tangent vector components (e.g., dρ/ds,dz/ds,dϕ/ds or dx/ds,dy/ds,dz/ds) for the following four critical points:
The last point of the incoming helical path segment (just before it connects to the turnaround arc).
The first point of the generated circular arc turnaround segment.
The last point of the generated circular arc turnaround segment.
The first point of the outgoing (reversed) helical path segment.
This will help us verify numerically if the tangent vectors are truly collinear or smoothly transitioned at these interfaces, as intended by the Koussios principles (e.g., Koussios Thesis, Ch. 2, Eq. 2.19).
Confirm Visualization of Turnaround Points:

Can you confirm if the 3D visualization logic is explicitly plotting all intermediate points of the _generate_polar_turnaround_segment, or if it might be simplifying the path by drawing a straight line between the start and end points of this segment if they are very close in space?
The claimed implementation of a 24-point circular arc should theoretically produce a more noticeable curve than a line segment, unless the arc length is extremely small or there's an issue in the tangent matching or visualization. Let's get this data to understand what the current code is producing at these critical turnaround points.
