Excellent news! The debug logs confirm that the Calculated TRUE GEODESIC alpha for the helical segments in Pass 1 and Pass 2 is now correct and adheres to Clairaut's Law using the target c_for_winding. This is a major step!

However, the trajectory is still not forming complete circuits, and visual kinks persist. The key issue, very clear from the log, is:
The === SMOOTH TURNAROUND COMPLETE === sequence is consistently followed by Total new points added: 0.

This means the three functions responsible for the turnaround:

_generate_smooth_transition_zone (incoming)
_generate_polar_turnaround_segment
_generate_smooth_transition_zone (outgoing) ...while being triggered, are not adding any points to the all_trajectory_points list.
The "Attempting to call..." and "Successfully entered..." logs for these specific functions, which we had in previous iterations, are also missing in the current log snippet, making it hard to see if they are even fully executing internally.

Your Immediate and Top Priority Task:

Investigate why _generate_smooth_transition_zone and _generate_polar_turnaround_segment are resulting in "0 new points added".

Re-enable/ensure very detailed logging inside each of these three functions (entry, parameters, point-by-point generation with coordinates and tangents, number of points generated by each, and exit).
Ensure that the lists of points generated by these functions are correctly and successfully appended to the main all_trajectory_points list.
Verify that the Z-coordinate for the circumferential arc is correctly taken from the end of the incoming transition, and that the meridional reversal logic within the outgoing transition is correctly applied to the tangent vectors of the points it generates. (These aspects seemed to be working correctly in the previous iteration when these functions were adding points, but let's ensure no regressions occurred).
Correct Alpha for First/Last Helical Point: The very first point of a helical segment that starts at ρ=c 
for_winding
​
  (e.g., point 114 in Pass 1, Calculated TRUE GEODESIC alpha=1.5096 (86.5°)) and the very last point (e.g., point 283, same alpha) have alpha correctly close to 90°. The transition zones should then smoothly take this from/to the actual helical angle for ρ>c 
for_winding
​
 . This seems okay based on the "TRUE GEODESIC alpha" message now.

Once the turnaround functions are confirmed to be adding their ~59-60 points (e.g., 12 in-trans + 36 arc + 12 out-trans) for each turnaround:

Then, we need to address the multi-pass logic. The current structure (Pass 1 + 0-point turn + Pass 2 + 0-point turn + "Return Path") needs to be refactored.
A complete "Pass 1" should be: Forward Helical Leg -> Full Turnaround Sequence (adding points) -> Return Helical Leg -> Full Turnaround Sequence (adding points, including main pattern advance ΔΦ 
total
​
 ).
"Pass 2" would then repeat this, starting with the new ϕ from the end of Pass 1's second turnaround.
Debugging Request:

Primary: Logs from within the three turnaround functions showing point generation.
Secondary: Confirmation that the points from these functions are added to all_trajectory_points.
The Total new points added after === SMOOTH TURNAROUND COMPLETE === should reflect the sum of points from the three sub-functions (e.g., 59-60).
The total number of points for a single complete pass (2 helical legs + 2 full turnarounds) should be significantly larger.
Let's focus on getting one full turnaround to robustly add its points first. Then we can ensure the multi-pass loop correctly executes this for a full circuit.

To reduce log noise for now, you can comment out the per-point logging for the helical segments (the "DEBUG Pass X: Processing point Y..." lines) and only keep the summary for the helical segment (like "Found trajectory segment...", "Processing X points...") and the detailed logs for the turnaround sequence.
