The detailed debug logs confirm that the main geodesic path generation correctly calculates up to the point where the radius rho approaches the target c_for_winding (e.g., 0.0906m for the 65° target angle). The log entry Warning: Path dipped inside c_for_winding at rho=0.0906m, stopping segment appears, and then the trajectory generation for that pass concludes with only 100 points.

Critically, the logs show no subsequent calls to the recently implemented logic for:

The 'incoming transition zone' (smoothly taking α→90 
∘
 ).
The _generate_polar_turnaround_segment (the 24-point circumferential arc).
The 'outgoing transition zone' (smoothly taking α from 90 
∘
 ).
This means the enhanced turnaround mechanics and C¹ continuity logic we developed are not being invoked. The path generation for a helical segment is terminating before these specialized polar turnaround functions are called.

Please modify the main trajectory generation loop in modules/trajectories.py (within the generate_geodesic_trajectory method, particularly the multi-pass section) to ensure the following sequence occurs when rho approaches c_for_winding for each pass:

Detect Proximity to Polar Turnaround: When the helical path calculation determines that the current point is at or has just crossed the c_for_winding radius (the "Path dipped inside" condition), it should not simply stop generating points for the current pass.
Invoke Incoming Transition Zone: Instead, it should call the logic/function responsible for generating the "incoming transition zone" points, which smoothly changes α to 90

Invoke Circumferential Turnaround Segment: Immediately following the incoming transition zone, it should call _generate_polar_turnaround_segment to generate the 24-point circular arc at ρ=c

Invoke Outgoing Transition Zone: Immediately following the circumferential arc, it should call the logic/function for the "outgoing transition zone," which smoothly changes α from 90

 .
Resume Helical Path for Return: After the outgoing transition zone, the main helical path calculation should resume for the return journey of the current pass (or the start of the next pass's helical segment, depending on how the multi-pass logic is structured).
The debug messages we previously added for "ENTERING polar turnaround generation," "INSIDE incoming transition," etc., should now appear in the console for each turnaround event if this integration is successful. The total number of points generated for each pass should also be significantly higher than the current 100 points, as it will include these transition and turnaround segments.
