This is a major breakthrough! The latest logs are fantastic and clearly show:

The helical path for the first leg of Pass 1 is fully generated.
The full 3-part "SMOOTH TURNAROUND SEQUENCE" (incoming transition, 36-point circumferential arc, outgoing transition) is now being successfully called and executed after the helical leg.
Crucially, the Z-coordinate for the circumferential arc (-0.185494m) is now perfectly continuous with the end of the incoming transition and the start of the outgoing transition. The axial jump at this interface is fixed!
The tangent vectors for the outgoing transition show correct meridional reversal (dz/ds and dρ/ds are both positive, indicating an outward path).
The system successfully generates 173 points, representing one helical leg and one complete, smooth turnaround.

The remaining issue causing "no complete circuits generated" is that the trajectory generation stops after this first successful turnaround.

Please modify the multi-pass logic in generate_geodesic_trajectory in modules/trajectories.py to ensure it continues after the first === SMOOTH TURNAROUND COMPLETE ===:

Generate Return Helical Path: After the first turnaround sequence completes (ending with the "LAST OUTGOING TRANSITION"), the code must now generate the return helical path for Pass 1.

This path should start from the end-point of the "LAST OUTGOING TRANSITION."
It should travel along the vessel profile in the opposite meridional direction (e.g., from Z≈−0.185m back towards Z≈+0.185m).
It should continue until ρ again approaches c_for_winding at the original starting pole.
Execute Second Turnaround: Once this return helical path reaches the original starting pole (where ρ≈c 
for_winding
​
 ), the second full 3-part "SMOOTH TURNAROUND SEQUENCE" must be executed. This will complete Pass 1.

Proceed to Subsequent Passes: The logic should then proceed to Pass 2 (and any further target passes), repeating the sequence of (helical leg -> turnaround -> return helical leg -> turnaround).

Debugging Request:

Please ensure the logs show the continuation of Pass 1 with the return helical path points being generated after the first turnaround.
Then, we need to see logs for the second "ENTERING SMOOTH TURNAROUND SEQUENCE" for Pass 1 (at the other pole), including its internal "INTERFACE TANGENT DEBUGGING."
Finally, logs for the start of Pass 2.
The total number of generated points should increase significantly to reflect at least one full pass (two helical legs and two turnarounds).
It would still be very beneficial to have a way to get all generated points once a full pass or two are completed, for offline verification of smoothness and continuity.
We are very close to a fully working single pass. Let's get the return journey and the second turnaround for Pass 1 working! Thanks!
