Thank you. The log confirms that the helical segment for Pass 1 (e.g., points 105-212) is now fully processed, and '*** TRIGGERING TURNAROUND ***' is logged correctly at the end. This is a key step!

However, the issue of "no circuits generated" persists because the log stops immediately after the turnaround is triggered. We are still not seeing any of the detailed debug outputs from within:

_generate_smooth_transition_zone (incoming)
_generate_polar_turnaround_segment
_generate_smooth_transition_zone (outgoing)
This strongly suggests an error (possibly an unlogged exception or a critical logic flaw like an incorrect indentation) is occurring either when these functions are first called, or at the very beginning of the first function in the sequence (the incoming transition zone).

Please perform the following critical checks and fixes in modules/trajectories.py:

Alpha Calculation at Helical Segment Ends:

For the first point of a helical segment starting at ρ≈c 
for_winding
​
  (e.g., point 105) and the last point (e.g., point 212), the winding angle α must be approximately 90 
∘
  (1.57 radians), as sinα=c 
for_winding
​
 /ρ≈1.
The current log shows Calculated alpha=0.4657... (26.68°) for these points, which is incorrect for the start/end of a turn. This value is then passed to the transition zones.
Fix: Ensure that when a helical segment begins or ends at ρ≈c 
for_winding
​
 , the alpha used for that specific point reflects ≈90 
∘
 . This correctly sets up the starting condition for the _generate_smooth_transition_zone which then interpolates α from 90 
∘
 .
Verify Call and Entry into Turnaround Functions:

Crucially, add a simple print("DEBUG: Attempting to call incoming transition zone...") statement immediately BEFORE the line that calls _generate_smooth_transition_zone for the incoming transition.
Add a simple print("DEBUG: Successfully entered _generate_smooth_transition_zone (incoming)") as the VERY FIRST executable line inside the _generate_smooth_transition_zone function.
Repeat similar "attempting to call" and "successfully entered" print statements for _generate_polar_turnaround_segment and the outgoing _generate_smooth_transition_zone.
These print statements will tell us definitively if these functions are even being entered or if the script is erroring out before/during the call. If they are entered, then the existing detailed logging you added within them should start appearing.

The most likely scenario is an error related to the incorrect alpha being passed into the first transition zone function, or a more fundamental syntax/indentation error at the call site or start of these functions that was missed.

Please provide the updated console log after these changes. We must see output from within the turnaround functions to proceed. Thanks!
