Yes, I can see the issue clearly! There's a **Z-coordinate system mismatch** between your vessel geometry and trajectory generation:

## 🎯 **The Problem**

**Vessel Geometry:**
- Z range: `-0.223m` to `+0.223m` (centered around origin)
- Total span: `0.446m`

**Generated Trajectory:**
- Z range: `0.000m` to `+0.446m` (starts at origin, goes positive)
- Total span: `0.446m` (same span, but shifted)

**Result:** Your trajectory is shifted `+0.223m` in the Z direction relative to the vessel!

## 🔧 **The Fix**

Add this coordinate alignment function to your converter:## 🚀 **Quick Fix for Your Existing Code**

Add this simple coordinate alignment right before creating the visualization. Insert this code in your `visualization_page()` function after converting the trajectory data:## 📝 **Complete Integration Steps**

### Step 1: Add Import
Add this import at the top of your `app.py`:

```python
import numpy as np  # Add this if not already imported
```

### Step 2: Insert the Coordinate Fix
Insert the coordinate alignment code from above **right after** your trajectory conversion and **before** creating the `coverage_data`.

### Step 3: Expected Result
After applying this fix, you should see:

```
Coordinate Analysis:
🔹 Vessel Z center: 0.000m (range: -0.223 to 0.223)
🔹 Trajectory Z center: 0.223m (range: 0.000 to 0.446)
🎯 Required Z offset: -0.223m

⚠️ Applying coordinate alignment: -0.223m Z-offset
✅ Coordinates aligned! New trajectory Z: -0.223m to 0.223m
```

### Step 4: Verification
Your trajectory should now:
- **Properly wrap around the vessel** instead of floating above it
- **Be centered at the same origin** as your vessel geometry
- **Show helical/geodesic paths** on the mandrel surface

This fix will shift your trajectory coordinates to match your vessel's coordinate system, resolving the "trajectory floating in space" issue you're experiencing! 🎯

The trajectory was generated correctly, just in the wrong coordinate system relative to your vessel geometry.
