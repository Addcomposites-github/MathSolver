This is a very insightful debug log! It clearly shows why "no path is being generated."

Analysis of the Log:

Correct c_eff and Target Angle Validation:

CALCULATED c_eff before assignment: 0.039648 m (This is the smallest possible effective polar opening based on roving geometry and the actual vessel pole).
Target cylinder angle: 62.00°
Implied Clairaut's constant: 88.29mm (This is R 
cyl
​
 ×sin(62 
∘
 ))
Using Clairaut's constant c = 0.088295 m (This is c_for_winding, the radius at which the 62° path would naturally turn if it could exist there).
This part is working correctly – the system knows the target trajectory requires a "virtual" polar opening of 88.29mm for the helical section.
The Core Problem in Pass 1:

DEBUG Pass 1: Processing point 0: ρ=0.032969m z=0.222986m c_for_winding=0.088295m
DEBUG Pass 1: Radius condition check: ρ=0.032969 >= c-tol=0.088295 = False
DEBUG Pass 1: SKIPPING point - radius too small (ρ=0.032969 < c_for_winding-tol=0.088295)
This sequence repeats for all points (0 through 102) of the adaptive vessel profile that the code iterates through.
Reason: The actual physical radii of the vessel's dome (starting from ρ≈0.033m near the true pole) are all smaller than the c_for_winding (0.088295m) required by the 62° target angle on the cylinder.
A geodesic path defined by a Clairaut's constant C can only exist on the mandrel where the mandrel's radius ρ 
mandrel
​
 ≥C. If ρ 
mandrel
​
 <C, sinα=C/ρ 
mandrel
​
  would be greater than 1, which is impossible.
"POLAR OPENING DETECTED" after skipping all points:

DEBUG: *** POLAR OPENING DETECTED *** at ρ=0.088233, c_for_winding=0.088295, diff=0.00006156
This message is confusing in this context. It appears after the loop that processes the adaptive profile points has already skipped all of them. It's likely a leftover check or a point on the original profile that happens to be near c_for_winding, but no path points were actually laid down to "reach" it.
Conclusion:
The trajectory generation for Pass 1 isn't "failing" due to a bug in an algorithm per se, but because the starting premise is incorrect for the given target angle. You cannot start winding a geodesic path defined by c_for_winding = 0.088295m at the actual physical pole of the vessel where ρ is only 0.032969m.

The path generation must start at the first point on the vessel profile where the vessel radius ρ becomes equal to c_for_winding. At this starting point, the winding angle α will be 90 
∘
 . From there, the path will proceed towards the cylinder (or the other pole), with α decreasing according to Clairaut's law (ρsinα=c 
for_winding
​
 ).

Next Prompt for the Replit Agent:

"Hi Replit Agent,

The latest debug log for Pass 1 was very clear. It shows that for the target angle (e.g., 62°, resulting in c_for_winding = 0.088295m), all points on the adaptive vessel profile (which starts at the physical pole where ρ≈0.033m) are being skipped because their radii are less than c_for_winding. This is correct according to geodesic theory (sinα=c 
for_winding
​
 /ρ requires ρ≥c 
for_winding
​
 ).

The current logic tries to start the path from the vessel's actual pole and iterate outwards. This won't work when c_for_winding is larger than the vessel's starting polar radius.

Please modify the trajectory generation logic in generate_geodesic_trajectory in modules/trajectories.py as follows for each pass (forward and reverse):

Determine the Correct Starting Point on the Vessel Profile:

Given the c_for_winding (Clairaut's constant for the target helical angle), find the first point (index i_start) in the adaptive vessel profile array (self.adaptive_profile_points) where the vessel radius adaptive_profile_points[i_start]['rho'] is approximately equal to c_for_winding.
The trajectory for the helical segment should begin at this point.
At this i_start, the initial winding angle α will be 90 
∘
 . The initial ϕ can be set (e.g., based on pass number and pattern advance).
Generate Helical Path from this Starting Point:

Once this correct starting point on the profile (where ρ=c 
for_winding
​
 ) is identified, proceed to generate the helical path points along the vessel profile (e.g., towards the cylinder and the other pole) using the Clairaut's relation ρsinα=c 
for_winding
​
  to determine α at each subsequent ρ.
The loop should continue until it reaches the c_for_winding radius at the other end of the vessel, where the turnaround sequence should then be triggered.
Handling Physical c 
eff
​
 : The physical minimum c_eff (e.g., 0.039648m in the log, based on roving geometry) is important for knowing the true limit of how small the polar opening of the wound path can be. The trajectory itself, however, for a given target angle, is governed by the larger c_for_winding. The path simply cannot exist on the mandrel where ρ<c 
for_winding
​
 .

Debugging Output Requested:

Log the identified starting point (index, ρ,z,ϕ,α=90 
∘
 ) for each helical leg (forward and reverse).
Log the first few points generated for the helical leg, showing their ρ,z,ϕ,α to confirm the path starts correctly from ρ=c 
for_winding
​
  with α=90 
∘
  and then α starts decreasing.
Then, log the entry into the turnaround sequence when the other pole (again at ρ=c 
for_winding
​
 ) is reached.
This change should allow paths to be generated for any valid target angle where c_for_winding is less than the vessel's equatorial radius but potentially larger than its physical polar opening radius
