The debug output is helpful. The "Warning: Path dipped inside c_for_winding at rho=0.0375m, stopping segment" indicates the helical path generation correctly identifies when it reaches the effective polar opening (c 
eff
​
  = 0.037558m).

However, the visual result in the 3D plot is still a sharp kink, appearing as if the turnaround is just a point or a very short line segment. We need to ensure the _generate_polar_turnaround_segment is:
a) Being correctly triggered and executed AFTER the incoming helical segment stops.
b) Generating a distinct circular arc with its 24 points.
c) Seamlessly integrated (position and tangent) between the incoming and outgoing helical paths.

Please add or verify the following debug outputs specifically around the call to _generate_polar_turnaround_segment and within it:

Confirmation of Call:

Log a message right BEFORE _generate_polar_turnaround_segment is called (e.g., "DEBUG: Entering polar turnaround generation for pass X").
Log a message right AFTER it returns (e.g., "DEBUG: Exited polar turnaround generation. Number of turnaround points generated: [count]").
Turnaround Segment Parameters & Output:

Inside _generate_polar_turnaround_segment, log the input parameters it receives: starting ϕ (phi_start_rad_turn), the calculated angular span for pattern advancement (Δϕ 
turnaround
​
 ), and c 
eff
​
 .
Log the first, a middle (e.g., 12th), and the last (24th) point coordinates (cylindrical and Cartesian) actually generated by this method. We need to see if these points trace a curve with a perceptible angular span.
Tangent Vector Verification at Interfaces (Re-check with new context):

Log the tangent vector of the very last point of the incoming helical path (the one that triggered the "Path dipped inside" warning).
Log the tangent vector of the first point generated by _generate_polar_turnaround_segment.
Log the tangent vector of the last point generated by _generate_polar_turnaround_segment.
Log the tangent vector of the first point of the subsequent outgoing helical path. (These tangent vectors should confirm if the explicit matching is working as described in your previous update).
Path Integration Check:

How are the points from _generate_polar_turnaround_segment being integrated into the main trajectory_points list? Are they replacing the last point of the helical segment, or being appended correctly?
The key is to confirm that the specialized turnaround code is indeed executing, what its geometric output is (is the Δϕ 
turnaround
​
  significant enough to form a visible arc?), and that the hand-off (tangent matching) between the helical segments and this arc segment is flawless. If Δϕ 
turnaround
​
  is near zero, the 24 points will essentially be on top of each other, appearing as a point or a tiny line.
