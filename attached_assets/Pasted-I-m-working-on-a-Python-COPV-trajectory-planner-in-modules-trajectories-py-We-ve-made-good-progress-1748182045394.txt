I'm working on a Python COPV trajectory planner in modules/trajectories.py. We've made good progress on generating multi-pass geodesic paths with a 3-part polar turnaround sequence:

An 'incoming transition zone' (helical α smoothly to 90 
∘
 ).
A 'circumferential arc' (at ρ=c 
for_winding
​
 , α=90 
∘
 , for pattern advance Δϕ).
An 'outgoing transition zone' (α smoothly from 90 
∘
  to helical, with correct meridional reversal).
Recent debug logs confirm that Z-coordinate continuity for the circumferential arc and correct dz/ds & dρ/ds signs for the outgoing path are now implemented.

The Remaining Challenge:
Despite these fixes and increased point density (11-12 points in transitions, 36 in the arc), the 3D visualization of the polar turnaround still appears as sharply joined segments or a "kink," rather than a smooth, flowing curve. The "line segment" appearance suggests the transition zones might be too linear.

Your Task:

Please focus on the geometric smoothness of the path generated within the _generate_smooth_transition_zone function (or its equivalent).

Review Path Point Calculation: How are the intermediate (ρ,z,ϕ) points calculated within the incoming and outgoing transition zones? While the winding angle α is being interpolated smoothly (e.g., via cubic spline), we need to ensure this results in a path that is itself a smooth curve and not just a series of points along a near-straight line that only changes direction significantly at the very end.
Curvature Management: How does the path's radius of curvature change within these transition zones? For a visually smooth blend, the path should start to curve (its radius of curvature should decrease from the larger radius of curvature of the helical path) as it enters the transition, smoothly fairing into the curvature of the circumferential arc (which is c 
for_winding
​
 ), and vice-versa on exit.
Implement Enhancements (if needed): If the current point generation in the transition zones is too linear, please modify it to produce a more continuously curving path. This might involve a more sophisticated interpolation of the path points themselves, ensuring the rate of change of the tangent vector's direction is gradual throughout the transition. (I can provide specific concepts from Koussios Ch. 2 on "Curves in Space," e.g., related to Frenet frames or ensuring finite path curvature k 
t
​
 , if you require theoretical guidance for this step).
Debugging Request:
Please provide debug output focusing on:

The calculated tangent vectors [dρ/ds,dz/ds,dϕ/ds] at several intermediate points within both the incoming and outgoing transition zones.
If possible, an estimate of the path's radius of curvature at these same intermediate points.
The goal is a visually seamless and C¹ continuous curve through the entire polar turnaround in the 3D plot. Also, could you please try to keep responses concise and focused on the technical changes and log outputs? Thank you!
