This is great progress! The latest log shows that the "POLAR OPENING DETECTED" and "*** TRIGGERING TURNAROUND ***" messages are now appearing. This confirms the turnaround trigger logic is being reached.

However, it seems the turnaround is triggered immediately at the very first valid point of the helical segment (e.g., point 100 in Pass 1), without generating the actual helical path along the vessel to the other pole.

The log shows:

DEBUG: Found trajectory segment from index 100 to 217 (This is the expected range for the helical path).
DEBUG: Processing 118 points for this pass (Correct number of points in that segment).
But then, after processing only point 100, the turnaround is triggered.
This indicates that the loop responsible for generating the points along the helical segment (from point 100 to point 217 in this case) is not executing or is exiting prematurely.

Please modify the generate_geodesic_trajectory function in modules/trajectories.py to ensure that:

After identifying the starting point of a helical leg (e.g., index 100 where ρ≈c 
for_winding
​
  and initial α≈90 
∘
 ), the code iterates through the subsequent points of the identified segment (e.g., from index 100 up to index 217 for the forward journey of Pass 1).
For each point in this helical segment, it should:
Calculate the winding angle α using Clairaut's law (sinα=c 
for_winding
​
 /ρ 
current
​
 ).
Calculate the incremental dϕ.
Append the new path point (ρ,z,ϕ,α) and its tangent.
The turnaround sequence should only be triggered AFTER this loop has processed all points in the helical segment and has reached the other end of the vessel (e.g., near point 217), where ρ is again approximately equal to c_for_winding. The last_point flag in the turnaround trigger should become True at this stage.
Debugging Request:

Please ensure the "Pass X: Processing point Y..." logs show iteration through a significant number of points for the helical segment.
We should then see the "ENTERING SMOOTH TURNAROUND SEQUENCE" logs appear after the helical segment is complete, followed by the "INTERFACE TANGENT DEBUGGING," etc.
Crucially, let's verify the Calculated alpha at point 100. If ρ≈c 
for_winding
​
 , α should be very close to 90 
∘
  (approx 1.57 radians). The current value of 0.4767... rad (27.3°) is incorrect for a point at the effective polar opening and might be contributing to the loop issue. Please check how α is initialized or calculated for the very first point of such a helical segment.
The goal is to see the generation of the helical path points first, then the execution of the full turnaround sequence, for each leg of each pass. Thank you!
