The latest debug logs are incredibly detailed and show we are very close!

Key Successes:

The full turnaround sequence (incoming transition, circumferential arc, outgoing transition) is now being correctly called when ρ approaches c 
for_winding
​
 .
The "TURNAROUND SEGMENT DEBUG" shows the 24-point circumferential arc is generated correctly with purely circumferential tangents.
The "INTERFACE TANGENT DEBUGGING" shows perfect tangent matching between:
"LAST INCOMING TRANSITION" and "FIRST CIRCUMFERENTIAL POINT" (both are correctly circumferential).
"LAST CIRCUMFERENTIAL POINT" and "FIRST OUTGOING TRANSITION" (both are correctly circumferential).
The Core Remaining Issue & "Wrong Direction" Problem:

The "INTERFACE TANGENT DEBUGGING" reveals the problem in the "LAST OUTGOING TRANSITION" tangent:

LAST OUTGOING TRANSITION: Tangent: dρ/ds=0.379363 dz/ds=**-0.826394** dφ/ds=4.424441
The dz/ds component here is still negative (-0.826394). This means that after the entire turnaround sequence, the path is still trying to move towards the same pole it just turned at, instead of moving away towards the other pole/equator.
While the "DEBUG MERIDIONAL REVERSAL" log shows Outgoing dz/ds sign: 0.909309 (towards equator), this sign change is not being correctly applied or propagated when calculating the actual tangent vector and subsequent points for the "outgoing transition zone" and the following helical segment.
This explains why the 3D plot "looks very bad as multiple circle segments try to connect" and "seems wrong direction" – the path isn't truly reversing its meridional direction of travel, causing it to immediately try and turn around again (as seen by the second "ENTERING SMOOTH TURNAROUND SEQUENCE" in the log).
Please focus on this specific task:

Ensure that when the "outgoing transition zone" and the subsequent helical path points are generated after a turnaround:

The sign of the meridional components of the tangent vector (specifically dz/ds, and dρ/ds as appropriate) is correctly reversed compared to the incoming path, reflecting the change in winding direction from "towards pole" to "away from pole."
The calculate_geodesic_point_and_tangent (or equivalent function that generates points for the helical and transition segments) correctly uses this reversed meridional direction when calculating subsequent points after a turnaround. The logic for interpolating α from 90 
∘
  back to the helical angle during the outgoing transition is likely correct, but the underlying vector direction for "away from pole" needs to be strictly enforced.
The goal is that the "LAST OUTGOING TRANSITION" tangent should have a dz/ds that is effectively the positive counterpart (e.g., +0.826394) of the incoming helical path's dz/ds (if the profile is symmetric and α returns to the same magnitude).

Let's verify this with the "INTERFACE TANGENT DEBUGGING" logs for the "LAST OUTGOING TRANSITION" and the first few points of the new helical segment.
