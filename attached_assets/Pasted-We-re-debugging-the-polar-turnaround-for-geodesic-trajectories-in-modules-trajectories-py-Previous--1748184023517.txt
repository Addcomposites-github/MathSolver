We're debugging the polar turnaround for geodesic trajectories in modules/trajectories.py.
Previous logs (like the one I'm basing this on) show:

The 3-part turnaround sequence (incoming transition, circumferential arc, outgoing transition) is correctly triggered.
Crucially, the Z-coordinate for the circumferential arc is now correctly and continuously derived from the Z of the last point of the incoming transition zone (e.g., -0.222572m in the log). This has fixed the major axial jump at the arc itself for the first turnaround.
The intent for meridional reversal in the outgoing transition is logged (Outgoing dz/ds sign: positive).
The very final point logged after the entire outgoing transition sometimes shows a correct positive dz/ds.
The Persistent Critical Problem:
Despite the above, the 3D visualization still shows kinks/line segments and "wrong transition profiles," often looking like the path tries to turn back on itself or doesn't smoothly leave the pole.

The primary remaining bug, clearly visible in the detailed logs within the outgoing transition zone, is:
The tangent vectors of the points generated inside the _generate_smooth_transition_zone for the outgoing transition do not reflect the meridional reversal.
* For example, the log showed for an outgoing transition:
Point 6 (Mid-outgoing transition): Tangent: ... dz/ds=**-0.243673** ... (still negative, i.e., towards the pole)
Point 11 (End of outgoing transition): Tangent: ... dz/ds=**-0.814665** ... (still negative)
* This happens even though the DEBUG MERIDIONAL REVERSAL indicated an Outgoing dz/ds sign: positive.

Your Specific Task for This Session:

Focus entirely on the _generate_smooth_transition_zone function in modules/trajectories.py.
When this function is called with reverse_meridional=True (for an outgoing transition):
Ensure that the logic used to calculate the tangent vector components (dρ/ds, dz/ds) for every point generated within this zone correctly applies the reversed meridional direction.
This means if the incoming dz/ds was negative (towards the pole), the dz/ds for points in the outgoing transition should become positive (away from the pole).
Similarly, dρ/ds should reflect an outward radial movement for an expanding dome if dz/ds is positive. The current log shows the final dρ/ds after the outgoing transition is positive, so the fix should ensure points within the transition also build towards this correctly.
Debugging Output Requested:
To verify the fix, please ensure the "ENHANCED TRANSITION ZONE DEBUGGING" for the outgoing transition zone clearly shows:

Point 0 (Start of outgoing): Tangent: dρ/ds=0.000... dz/ds=0.000... (correctly circumferential).
Intermediate points (e.g., Point 6): Tangent components, especially confirming dz/ds is now positive and dρ/ds is consistent with an outward path.
Point 11 (End of outgoing): Tangent: dρ/ds=[positive_value] dz/ds=[positive_value] ...
Additionally, please ensure the debug output for both turnaround events in a single full pass (e.g., to the -Z pole and then to the +Z pole) is captured, so we can confirm the Z-coordinate for the circumferential arc is correct at both ends.

For conciseness, please focus agent responses on the direct changes made to address this tangent vector direction within the outgoing transition and the resulting debug logs. Thank you!
