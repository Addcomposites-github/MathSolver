Thank you for the recent updates. The trajectory is now positionally continuous across multiple passes, and the pattern advancement logic seems correct for the φ angle.

However, as observed, there are still sharp 'kinks' at the polar turnaround points. While the position is continuous, the tangent of the path is not. This means the fiber is making an abrupt change in direction. The current "circumferential turnaround path segment" appears to be a straight line segment at α=90 
∘
  at the effective polar opening, which, while ensuring α=90 
∘
  there, doesn't smoothly blend the incoming and outgoing helical paths.

For the next refinement, we need to achieve true C 
1
  continuity (continuous tangent vector) through the polar turnaround.

Please focus on the following:

Smooth Transition into and out of the 90° Winding Angle:

The winding angle α must smoothly approach 90 
∘
  as the fiber reaches c 
eff
​
 , remain at 90 
∘
  for the pattern advancement segment, and then smoothly decrease as the fiber departs c 
eff
​
  on the return pass.
(Self-correction/guidance for you to provide to agent later): Based on Koussios Thesis, Ch. 2 (Curves in Space) and Ch. 5 & 6 (Trajectory equations like the Liouville equation for dα/ds), we need to ensure dα/ds is well-behaved and doesn't imply an infinite curvature or instantaneous jump in α itself, except for the defined segment at α=90 
∘
 . The transition into this state needs to be smooth.
Modeling the Polar Turnaround Segment as a Smooth Curve:

Instead of a simple straight circumferential line segment, the turnaround at c 
eff
​
  should be modeled as a smooth curve that connects the incoming helical path to the outgoing (reversed) helical path while achieving the necessary circumferential shift for pattern advancement.
This segment will be characterized by ρ=c 
eff
​
  and α=90 
∘
 . The key is how the curvature of the path is handled to make the entry and exit tangential.
(Self-correction/guidance for you to provide to agent later): Consult Koussios Thesis, Ch. 2, particularly concepts of path curvature (k 
t
​
 ) and the Frenet frame (Eq. 2.31). For the path to be smooth, its curvature k 
t
​
  must be finite. An abrupt kink implies infinite curvature. The path at the pole is essentially a segment of a circle of radius c 
eff
​
  in the plane tangent to the pole. The incoming path must become tangent to this circle, and the outgoing path must also be tangent as it leaves.
Ensuring Tangent Vector Continuity at Connection Points:

The tangent vector of the last point of the incoming helical segment must align with the tangent vector of the first point of the polar turnaround curve.
The tangent vector of the last point of the polar turnaround curve must align with the tangent vector of the first point of the outgoing (reversed) helical segment.
(Self-correction/guidance for you to provide to agent later): Using the tangent vector definition (e.g., Koussios Thesis, Eq. 2.19 or 5.17), we need to ensure C 
′
 (s 
end_pass
​
 )=C 
′
 (s 
start_turnaround
​
 ) and C 
′
 (s 
end_turnaround
​
 )=C 
′
 (s 
start_return_pass
​
 ), considering appropriate vector orientations and coordinate system transformations if necessary.)
Please modify the _generate_polar_turnaround_segment method in modules/trajectories.py and any related path generation logic. The goal is to replace the current straight circumferential segment with a calculated path segment (even if short) that ensures the overall trajectory is C 
1
  continuous. The 3D visualization should clearly show a smooth, flowing path without any sharp directional changes at the poles."
