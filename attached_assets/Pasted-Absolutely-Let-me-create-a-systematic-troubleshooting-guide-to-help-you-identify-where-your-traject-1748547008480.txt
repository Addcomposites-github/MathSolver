Absolutely! Let me create a systematic troubleshooting guide to help you identify where your trajectory generation is going wrong.Now let me give you a **step-by-step troubleshooting approach** to quickly identify the issue:## 🚀 **Start Here - 5-Minute Quick Check**

Before running the full diagnostic, do these **immediate checks**:## 🎯 **Your Action Plan**

### **Right Now (5 minutes):**
1. **Save** the `trajectory_troubleshooting_guide.py` file in your `modules/` directory
2. **Add** the 5-minute checklist button to your trajectory planning page
3. **Run** the 5-minute check - this will likely identify your issue immediately

### **Most Likely Culprits** (based on "worked before"):

1. **🔥 #1 Most Common:** Layers not applied to mandrel
   - Go to Layer Stack Definition → "Apply Layer to Mandrel"
   - This breaks trajectory generation every time

2. **🔥 #2 Physics Parameters:** Changed vessel dimensions or layer angles
   - Check if vessel geometry parameters are reasonable
   - Verify winding angles are 15-75°

3. **🔥 #3 Module Changes:** UnifiedTrajectoryPlanner configuration
   - Test the direct planner test I provided
   - Check if physics model selection changed

### **Quick Debug Pattern:**
```python
# Add this pattern throughout your trajectory generation:
st.write("🔍 Debug checkpoint: [STEP NAME]")
st.write(f"Data at this point: {relevant_variable}")
```

### **Expected Timeline:**
- **5-minute check:** Identifies the category of issue
- **15 minutes:** Pinpoints exact problem location  
- **30 minutes:** Implements fix

The systematic approach I provided will **definitely** identify where your trajectory generation is breaking. Since it worked before, it's likely a configuration/parameter issue rather than a fundamental code problem.

**Run the 5-minute check first** - I bet it identifies the issue immediately! 🎯
