This is a huge step forward! The log confirms that the Calculated TRUE GEODESIC alpha for all helical segments in Pass 1 and Pass 2 is now correct and strictly follows Clairaut's Law using the target c_for_winding. This is excellent and fixes a fundamental issue.

However, the main problem causing "no circuit generated" (or a visually incorrect one with sharp kinks) is that the turnaround sequence functions are still adding zero points.
The log shows for both Pass 1 and Pass 2 turnarounds:
=== SMOOTH TURNAROUND COMPLETE ===
Total new points added: 0

This means that _generate_smooth_transition_zone (incoming), _generate_polar_turnaround_segment, and _generate_smooth_transition_zone (outgoing) are not contributing their points to the trajectory. The detailed "Attempting to call..." and "Successfully entered..." logs for these three specific functions are also missing from the current log output, so we can't see if they are even being entered correctly.

Your Immediate and Top Priority Task:

Debug Turnaround Point Generation:

Focus entirely on why the three turnaround functions (_generate_smooth_transition_zone and _generate_polar_turnaround_segment) are resulting in "0 new points added."
Re-enable or ensure the following logs are active and visible:
print("DEBUG: Attempting to call incoming transition zone...") (BEFORE the call)
print("DEBUG: Successfully entered _generate_smooth_transition_zone (incoming)") (FIRST line inside the function)
Similar "Attempting to call..." and "Successfully entered..." for _generate_polar_turnaround_segment and the outgoing _generate_smooth_transition_zone.
Crucially, within each of these three functions, log the list of points just before the function returns, and confirm that this list is being correctly appended to the main all_trajectory_points list.
Ensure the Z-coordinate for the circumferential arc is derived from the actual Z of the last point of the incoming transition zone. (This seemed fixed for the arc's internal points, but the connection might be the issue if points aren't added).
Ensure the meridional reversal logic is correctly applied within the outgoing transition zone to its generated points.
Multi-Pass Logic Refinement (Once Turnarounds Add Points):

The current structure (Helical Leg 1 -> 0-Point Turn -> Helical Leg 2 -> 0-Point Turn -> Extra "Return Path") needs to be corrected.
A single complete "circuit" or "pass" (as in one full A→B→A cycle) should be:
Forward Helical Leg (e.g., Pole A to Pole B).
Full 3-Part Turnaround at Pole B (adding its ~59-60 points).
Return Helical Leg (Pole B to Pole A).
Full 3-Part Turnaround at Pole A (adding its ~59-60 points, this turn includes the main pattern advance ΔΦ 
total
​
  for the next circuit).
The Target passes: 2 should then generate two such complete circuits. The "RETURN HELICAL PATH FOR COMPLETE CIRCUIT" should likely be removed or integrated into this standard pass structure.
Debugging Output Requested for this Iteration:

The "Attempting to call..." and "Successfully entered..." logs for all three turnaround functions.
Logs from within these functions showing the number of points they individually generate.
The "Total new points added" after === SMOOTH TURNAROUND COMPLETE === should be non-zero (e.g., ~59-60 points).
The total number of points for ONE complete circuit (2 helical legs + 2 full turnarounds).
Let's get the turnaround functions to reliably add their points first. This is essential for visual smoothness and for the multi-pass logic to work correctly. Please minimize other verbose logs (like per-point helical logs) once we're sure alpha is fine there, so we can focus on the turnaround execution. Thank you!
