We need to address the smoothness of the 'Single Circuit' multi-pass trajectory. Currently, while the path is positionally continuous, there are sharp 'kinks' (tangent discontinuities) at the polar turnaround points.

Our goal is to achieve a smooth trajectory with tangent continuity at these joining points.

To do this, I will be providing you with specific mathematical formulations, principles, and algorithmic steps derived from filament winding literature (primarily Koussios's "Filament Winding: a Unified Approach" and Peters's "Composite Filament Winding").

Your task will be to implement the logic I provide to modify the trajectory calculation. We will focus on the following aspects for the turnaround at the effective polar opening:

Winding Angle (α) Behavior: The winding angle α should smoothly approach 90 degrees as the fiber reaches the effective polar opening and then smoothly transition as it departs. I will provide details on how this should be modeled based on the literature.

(User to later provide Replit Agent: e.g., "At c 
eff
​
 , α must be exactly 90 degrees. The rate of change dα/ds should be managed to avoid abrupt transitions just before and after this point. Consider Koussios Thesis, Ch. 5, Eq. 5.23 for the condition at c 
eff
​
 .")
Tangent Vector Continuity: The core task is to ensure the tangent vector of the path is continuous through the reversal.

(User to later provide Replit Agent: e.g., "We need to ensure that the vector C 
′
 (t) or its components (from Koussios Thesis, Ch. 2, Eq. 2.19 or 5.17) at the end of pass 'n' aligns with C 
′
 (t) at the start of pass 'n+1'. I'll provide guidance on how to calculate and match these derivatives or set up the start of the new pass.")
Modeling the Turnaround Path: This might involve a brief circumferential path segment at the effective polar radius.

(User to later provide Replit Agent: e.g., "At radius c 
eff
​
 , the fiber path should be purely circumferential (dρ/ds=0,dζ/ds=0) for a small segment. During this segment, the parallel angle φ will advance by Δϕ

​
  to set up the next pass. Then, the meridional travel will resume in the opposite direction. See Koussios Thesis Ch. 8 for pattern advancement concepts, though we'll need to define the micro-geometry of the turn.")
Please prepare the 'Single Circuit' multi-pass trajectory code in app.py (and relevant modules like trajectories.py) to incorporate these changes based on the detailed mathematical and algorithmic instructions I will provide in subsequent steps. We will then verify the smoothness using the 3D visualization and by examining the path derivatives."
