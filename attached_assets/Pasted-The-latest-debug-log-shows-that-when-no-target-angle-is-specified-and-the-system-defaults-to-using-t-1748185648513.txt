The latest debug log shows that when no target angle is specified and the system defaults to using the physical c 
eff
​
  as c_for_winding (e.g., 0.037137m):

The initial helical path generation for Pass 1 correctly identifies and processes the valid segment of the mandrel (e.g., points 11 to 306 where ρ≥c 
eff
​
 ). The winding angle α is also calculated for these points. This part seems to be working well.

However, the critical issue is that the "SMOOTH TURNAROUND SEQUENCE" is never triggered at the end of this first helical segment (e.g., after processing point 306). The code processes all 296 points for the helical leg of Pass 1 and then seems to move to Pass 2 without executing any turnaround.

The error "No valid trajectory points generated" then occurs during Pass 2, likely because Pass 1 didn't complete with a turnaround.

Please focus on the following in modules/trajectories.py within the generate_geodesic_trajectory function (specifically the multi-pass loop):

Turnaround Trigger Condition: After generating the points for a helical leg (e.g., the 296 points in Pass 1), what is the exact condition being checked to determine if a polar turnaround should be initiated?

It should detect that ρ at the end of the segment is again approximately equal to c_for_winding.
The current log shows DEBUG: *** POLAR OPENING DETECTED *** at ρ=0.088233... after skipping all points when a large target c_for_winding was used. This detection logic needs to be robustly applied at the end of successfully generated helical segments when using the physical c 
eff
​
  as c_for_winding.
Integration with Turnaround Logic: Ensure that once the end of a helical segment is reached (i.e., ρ is again close to c_for_winding at the other pole), the code correctly calls the sequence:

_generate_smooth_transition_zone (incoming)
_generate_polar_turnaround_segment
_generate_smooth_transition_zone (outgoing, with meridional reversal) ...before starting the next helical segment for the return journey or the next pass.
The immediate goal is to see the "ENTERING SMOOTH TURNAROUND SEQUENCE" and the subsequent "INTERFACE TANGENT DEBUGGING" logs appear after the first helical segment of Pass 1 is generated, and then again after the return helical segment, and so on for all specified passes.

To debug this, please add a log message immediately before the condition that checks if a turnaround should be initiated at the end of each helical segment, showing the current point's ρ, z, and the c_for_winding being used for comparison.

Also, as requested before, it would be very helpful if the full list of all generated trajectory points (positions and tangents for each pass and each segment type - helical, transitions, arc) could be made available, perhaps by writing them to st.session_state or a downloadable file, once the multi-pass generation is making more progress. For now, let's focus on getting the first turnaround to trigger. Thanks!
