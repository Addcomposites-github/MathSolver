🚀 Your Immediate Action Plan
RIGHT NOW (2 minutes):

Save both files (geodesic_validation_tests.py and focused_45_degree_debug.py) in your modules/ directory
Add this to your trajectory planning page:

python# Add these debug buttons
if st.button("⚡ Quick Reality Check"):
    from modules.geodesic_validation_tests import quick_geodesic_reality_check
    quick_geodesic_reality_check()

if st.button("🎯 Test My 45° Case"):
    from modules.focused_45_degree_debug import test_45_degree_case_now
    test_45_degree_case_now()

Click "Quick Reality Check" - this will immediately tell you if your trajectories are complete BS

Expected Results:
Scenario A: BS Detected 🚨
🚨 TRAJECTORY IS BS! Issues found:
- No radial variation - trajectory collapsed
- Trajectory much smaller than vessel - wrong scale
- Invalid winding angles detected
→ Your system is generating fake/fallback trajectories
Scenario B: Physics Broken 💥
❌ Even basic generation fails!
❌ Cannot import UnifiedTrajectoryPlanner
→ Your trajectory generation is completely broken
Scenario C: Scale Issues ⚖️
✅ Trajectory passes basic reality check
BUT: Trajectory much larger/smaller than vessel
→ Generation works but wrong coordinate system
Most Likely Smoking Gun:
Your issue is probably one of these:

🔥 #1: UnifiedTrajectoryPlanner is falling back to dummy data when physics fails
🔥 #2: Vessel geometry is not being passed correctly to the planner
🔥 #3: Physics calculations are producing garbage (NaN/inf) and falling back
🔥 #4: Layer stack integration is broken and using wrong mandrel geometry

Quick Diagnostic Questions:
Q1: When you run "Quick Reality Check", what exactly does it say?
Q2: When you generate trajectories, do you see any error messages in the console/logs?
Q3: What's your vessel diameter and length? (The physics might be broken for certain scales)
Q4: Are you applying layers to mandrel before trajectory planning?
The tests I provided will definitely catch where your system is generating BS instead of real geodesic trajectories. The 45° focused test will tell you exactly what's wrong with your specific case.
Run the Quick Reality Check first - I bet it immediately identifies the smoking gun! 🔍
