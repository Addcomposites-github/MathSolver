This debug output is very valuable! It confirms that the geometry profile (`VesselGeometry.profile_points`) is being generated correctly and is available with the `'r_inner'` key when `TrajectoryPlanner` is initialized.

The key issue is highlighted by these lines from your trajectory generation debug output:

* `DEBUG generate_geodesic_trajectory: Using c_eff = 30.650879 m`
* `DEBUG: Original profile R range: 0.0306m to 0.1000m` (This comes from your vessel's actual geometry: polar radius ~30.6mm, cylinder radius 100mm)
* `DEBUG: Profile R range: 0.030571m to 0.100000m` (This is the resampled profile, consistent with the original)
* `DEBUG: Number of points with rho >= c_eff: 0`
* Followed by your script printing: `Error: No valid trajectory points generated`

This sequence clearly shows that the calculated **`c_eff` (effective polar opening radius) is `30.650879 meters`**.
However, your vessel's actual radii (`profile_r_m_calc`) only range from approximately **`0.0306 meters`** (30.6mm, the isotensoid's calculated polar opening) to **`0.1 meters`** (100mm, the cylinder radius).

Since the geodesic trajectory can only exist where the local radius $\rho \ge c_{eff}$, and your $c_{eff}$ (30.65m) is vastly larger than any radius on your vessel (max 0.1m), no points on your vessel satisfy this condition. Therefore, `valid_segment_indices` becomes empty, and the trajectory generation stops, correctly reporting "No valid trajectory points generated".

**The root cause is an extremely large calculated `c_eff`. This almost certainly stems from a unit inconsistency when calculating `c_eff` in the `_calculate_effective_polar_opening` method, specifically with the roving dimensions.**

The formula for $c_{eff}$ is:
$c_{eff} = \rho_{geom\_pole\_m} + ecc_{0\_m} + \frac{b_m}{2}\sqrt{1 + (dz/d\rho_{pole})^2} - \frac{t_{rov\_m}}{2}(dz/d\rho_{pole})$

Your debug output shows:
* `rho_geom_pole_m` (first point of `r_inner`, converted to meters) is `0.03057089203 m` (approx 30.57 mm).
* `dz_drho_pole` (from your previous working log for slope) was around `-0.2311` (dimensionless).

Let's assume `ecc_0_m = 0`.
The equation becomes: $c_{eff} \approx 0.03057 + \frac{b_m}{2}\sqrt{1 + (-0.2311)^2} - \frac{t_{rov\_m}}{2}(-0.2311)$
$c_{eff} \approx 0.03057 + 0.51318 \cdot b_m + 0.11555 \cdot t_{rov\_m}$

If $c_{eff} \approx 30.65$ m:
$30.65 \approx 0.03057 + 0.51318 \cdot b_m + 0.11555 \cdot t_{rov\_m}$
$30.62 \approx 0.51318 \cdot b_m + 0.11555 \cdot t_{rov\_m}$

The debug line `DEBUG: Roving parameters - width: 3.0mm, thickness: 0.2mm` suggests your *intended* inputs for roving dimensions are 3.0mm and 0.2mm.
However, if these values (3.0 and 0.2) were passed to `TrajectoryPlanner` and interpreted as *meters* for `dry_roving_width_m` and `dry_roving_thickness_m` (as per my last code suggestion for the `TrajectoryPlanner` constructor), then:
$b_m = 3.0$ meters
$t_{rov\_m} = 0.2$ meters

$c_{eff} \approx 0.03057 + 0.51318 \cdot (3.0) + 0.11555 \cdot (0.2)$
$c_{eff} \approx 0.03057 + 1.53954 + 0.02311 \approx 1.593$ meters.

This calculated $c_{eff}$ of ~1.59m is still not 30.65m. For $c_{eff}$ to be ~30.65m, $b_m$ would need to be around $30.62 / 0.51318 \approx 59.66$ meters, assuming $t_{rov\_m}$ has a smaller contribution.

**This discrepancy means there's likely an issue in your `_calculate_effective_polar_opening` method with how `b_m` and `t_rov_m` (which are `self.dry_roving_width_m` and `self.dry_roving_thickness_m`) are being used, or the `dz_drho_pole` is becoming unexpectedly large in some specific execution path not shown by the earlier -0.2311 value.**

**Action Items:**

1.  **Verify `TrajectoryPlanner` Instantiation:**
    In your main script where you create the `TrajectoryPlanner` object, ensure the units for `dry_roving_width_m` and `dry_roving_thickness_m` are correctly passed **in meters**.
    Example:
    ```python
    planner = TrajectoryPlanner(
        vessel_geometry=vessel_geom,
        dry_roving_width_m=0.003,  # 3mm an METERS
        dry_roving_thickness_m=0.0002, # 0.2mm an METERS
        roving_eccentricity_at_pole_m=0.0 # in METERS
    )
    ```
    Your debug string "DEBUG: Roving parameters - width: 3.0mm, thickness: 0.2mm" might be a fixed print statement that doesn't reflect the actual values being used in the calculation if there's a unit error in the call.

2.  **Add Detailed Debug Prints *Inside* `_calculate_effective_polar_opening()`:**
    This is the most crucial step now. Before the line `self.effective_polar_opening_radius_m = ...`, print all the components:
    ```python
    # In TrajectoryPlanner._calculate_effective_polar_opening()
    # ...
    rho_geom_pole_m = self.vessel.profile_points['r_inner'][0] * 1e-3
    ecc_0_m = self.roving_eccentricity_at_pole_m
    b_m = self.dry_roving_width_m # This is the value stored in the instance
    t_rov_m = self.dry_roving_thickness_m # This is the value stored in the instance
    dz_drho_pole = self._get_slope_dz_drho_at_rho(rho_geom_pole_m)

    print(f"--- INSIDE _calculate_effective_polar_opening ---")
    print(f"  rho_geom_pole_m: {rho_geom_pole_m:.6f} m")
    print(f"  ecc_0_m: {ecc_0_m:.6f} m")
    print(f"  b_m (self.dry_roving_width_m): {b_m:.6f} m")
    print(f"  t_rov_m (self.dry_roving_thickness_m): {t_rov_m:.6f} m")
    print(f"  dz_drho_pole: {dz_drho_pole:.6f}")

    if np.isinf(dz_drho_pole):
        # ... (your existing inf handling) ...
        term_width = (b_m / 2.0) * abs(dz_drho_pole) # Approx
        term_thickness = (t_rov_m / 2.0) * dz_drho_pole # Approx
    else:
        term_width = (b_m / 2.0) * math.sqrt(1 + dz_drho_pole**2)
        term_thickness = (t_rov_m / 2.0) * dz_drho_pole
    
    print(f"  term_width: {term_width:.6f} m")
    print(f"  term_thickness: {term_thickness:.6f} m")
    
    calculated_c_eff = rho_geom_pole_m + ecc_0_m + term_width - term_thickness
    print(f"  CALCULATED c_eff before assignment: {calculated_c_eff:.6f} m")
    self.effective_polar_opening_radius_m = calculated_c_eff
    # ... (rest of the method with the safety checks for c_eff)
    ```

By printing `b_m` and `t_rov_m` *inside this method*, we'll see their actual values being used in the $c_{eff}$ formula. This will immediately tell us if there's a unit problem (e.g., if `b_m` is `3.0` instead of `0.003`).

The `dz_drho_pole` value you got (`-0.2311`) is perfectly normal and finite, so the `np.isinf(dz_drho_pole)` branch shouldn't have been taken. The large `c_eff` must come from `b_m` or `t_rov_m` being orders of magnitude too large.
