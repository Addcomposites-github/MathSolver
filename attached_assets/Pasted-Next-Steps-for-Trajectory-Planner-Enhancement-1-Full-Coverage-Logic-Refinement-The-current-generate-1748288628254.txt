Next Steps for Trajectory Planner Enhancement
1. Full Coverage Logic Refinement
The current generate_multi_circuit_trajectory uses a placeholder for pattern advancement. To achieve "full coverage," we need to implement a more rigorous approach based on winding pattern theory, primarily from Koussios's work (Chapter 8 in Extracted2-2004(1).pdf).

Objective: Instead of a fixed number of circuits for full coverage, the system should calculate or allow the user to choose from patterns that achieve a high degree of coverage (close to 100%) for a specified number of layers (typically one for initial implementation).
Inputs for Pattern Generation:
number_of_layers_d (e.g., 1).

dry_roving_width_m and dry_roving_thickness_m (already in __init__).
Vessel geometry: specifically equatorial_radius_m and effective_polar_opening_radius_m (c_for_winding).
Optionally, a target for n (number of bands side-by-side at the equator for one layer) or let the system find suitable patterns.
Calculation Steps (Conceptual, based on Koussios Ch. 8):
Calculate alpha_equator_rad: This depends on c_for_winding and equatorial_radius_m ($\alpha_{eq} = \arcsin(c_{\text{for_winding}} / R_{eq})$).
Calculate Effective Bandwidth at Equator (B_eff_equator): $B_{\text{eff_equator}} = \text{dry_roving_width_m} / \cos(\alpha_{\text{equator_rad}})$.
Calculate Angle Subtended by One Band at Equator (delta_phi_band_equator_rad): $\Delta\varphi = B_{\text{eff_equator}} / R_{eq}$ (using Koussios notation from Eq. 3.38).
Determine n_bands_equator_single_layer: $n = (2 \cdot \pi \cdot R_{eq}) / B_{\text{eff_equator}}$. This n is the number of bands to cover the equator for one layer. It might not be an integer. The goal of pattern theory is to find integer p (pattern repeat unit) and k (bands per pattern repeat unit advance) such that nd (for d layers) forms a closed pattern. For d=1, n is the target.
Turn-Around Angle (Delta_Phi_tot_rad, Koussios Κ or Φ_total): This is the crucial net azimuthal shift of the fiber band after one complete circuit (pole-A -> pole-B -> turnaround -> pole-A -> turnaround), relative to the starting meridian. It's calculated by integrating dφ over a full circuit using the actual geodesic path (as done in _generate_geodesic_leg and summed). The planner.turn_around_angle_rad from generate_geodesic_trajectory after one full circuit (2 legs + 2 simple turnarounds without pattern advance) would be a starting point, but the patterned Delta_Phi_tot_rad is what we need.
Solve Diophantine Equations (or use Koussios's pattern search logic):
pkd - nd = -1 (lagging) or (p+1)kd - nd = 1 (leading).

Given d=1 and a target n (from step 4, possibly rounded or iterated), find integer p (number of circuits to repeat the pattern) and k (number of band widths advanced per circuit).
The goal is to find p and k such that Delta_Phi_tot_rad * p is close to 2 * pi * k_some_integer_revolutions and also satisfies the Diophantine equation for the target n and d.
Koussios suggests (Eq. 8.14, 8.17): ΔΦ

​
 = 
p+1
2π
​
 ⋅(1+ 
nd

​
 ) and ΔΦ 
lagging
​
 = 
p
2π
​
 ⋅(1− 
nd

​
 ). We need to select p and k (from nd or band overlap criteria) to define the target Delta_Phi_tot_rad for our pattern.
Modify generate_multi_circuit_trajectory:
The advancement_angle_rad_per_full_circuit should now be this calculated Delta_Phi_tot_rad from pattern theory.
The phi_span_for_each_turnaround_rad in _generate_polar_turnaround_segment_fixed_phi_advance should be set such that the sum of the phi swept by the two legs and the two turnaround spans results in Delta_Phi_tot_rad relative to the start of the circuit. Let phi_sweep_leg1 and phi_sweep_leg2 be the natural phi swept by the geodesic legs. Then (phi_sweep_leg1 + turnaround_span1 + phi_sweep_leg2 + turnaround_span2) % (2*math.pi) = Delta_Phi_tot_rad % (2*math.pi). For a symmetric vessel and pattern, turnaround_span1 = turnaround_span2 = turnaround_span_patterned. So, 2 * turnaround_span_patterned = (Delta_Phi_tot_rad - (phi_sweep_leg1 + phi_sweep_leg2)) % (2*math.pi). This ensures the turnarounds achieve the additional shift required by the pattern.
2. Access to Slippage Factor (Friction Coefficient μ)
This is for non-geodesic trajectories. The current trajectory generation is focused on geodesics. To incorporate non-geodesics:

Add mu_friction_coefficient to TrajectoryPlanner.__init__:
Python

self.mu_friction_coefficient = mu_friction_coefficient # User input
Create a new method for non-geodesic paths, e.g., generate_non_geodesic_trajectory.
This method would use Koussios's differential equation for the winding angle α considering friction (Eq. 5.59 or 5.62 in Extracted2-2004(1).pdf):
(sin α)' = [μ * sqrt(G) * (k_p - k_m)] * sin²α + [- (1/2) * (E'/E)] * sin α + [μ * sqrt(G) * k_m]
This requires:
μ: The slippage factor (friction coefficient).
E(t), G(t): Coefficients of the first fundamental form of the mandrel surface.
k_m(t), k_p(t): Meridional and parallel curvatures of the mandrel surface.
This differential equation needs to be solved numerically (e.g., Runge-Kutta) to find α(t) along the mandrel profile.
Once α(t) is known, dφ/dt can be integrated to get the path (ρ(t), z(t), φ(t)).
The "5 options" you mentioned could relate to testing different μ values (e.g., 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) to see how the path changes, or it could be 5 different pattern solutions for geodesic winding.
3. Visualization Enhancements
Modify generate_multi_circuit_trajectory:
Ensure it returns a circuit_indices array in its output dictionary, corresponding to the path_points. Each point should be tagged with the circuit number it belongs to.
Modify plot_3d_trajectory:
Add a parameter circuits_to_display: Optional[List[int]] = None or num_circuits_to_display: Optional[int] = None.
If provided, filter the path_points based on the circuit_indices before plotting.
Optionally, use different colors for different circuits if num_circuits_to_display is small.
Proposed Plan of Attack:

Refine generate_multi_circuit_trajectory for Patterned Geodesic Winding (Simplified Pattern First):

Input: Add num_target_circuits_for_pattern_closure: int and pattern_skip_factor: int = 1 to generate_multi_circuit_trajectory.
Calculate Delta_Phi_pattern_rad: This will be the net azimuthal advance per full circuit. Delta_Phi_pattern_rad = (2 * math.pi / num_target_circuits_for_pattern_closure) * pattern_skip_factor.
Distribute to Turnarounds: The key is how _generate_polar_turnaround_segment_fixed_phi_advance uses its fixed_phi_advance_rad. This parameter is the span of the turnaround segment itself.
A simple approach: For a symmetric vessel, assume each of the two turnarounds in a full circuit contributes equally to the additional shift needed beyond what a minimal direction reversal would give.
Let phi_natural_turnaround_span_rad be a small angle for minimal direction reversal (e.g., math.pi / 36 for a 5-degree turn).
The fixed_phi_advance_rad for each turnaround segment will be phi_natural_turnaround_span_rad + (Delta_Phi_pattern_rad / 2.0).
generate_multi_circuit_trajectory will call _generate_geodesic_leg twice. current_phi_rad will accumulate. The phi_start for the first leg of circuit j will be (j-1) * Delta_Phi_pattern_rad.
Output: Add circuit_indices to the output data.
Update plot_3d_trajectory:

Implement the circuits_to_plot (or num_circuits_to_display) functionality using the circuit_indices.
(Later) Incorporate Full Koussios Pattern Search:

Create a new method find_optimal_patterns(...) that takes vessel geometry, roving width, and target layers.
This method would implement the logic from Koussios Ch. 8 (e.g., using Eqs. 3.32-3.43 from 3-2011. Composite Filament Winding.pdf which are Koussios's equations) to find sets of (p, k, d, n, B, T) that give good patterns.
This would then feed the chosen Delta_Phi_pattern_rad into generate_multi_circuit_trajectory.
(Later) Add Non-Geodesic Capability:

Introduce mu_friction_coefficient.
Create _generate_non_geodesic_leg which solves the differential equation for alpha(t) using mu and calculates phi(t).
Let's start with Step 1 & 2: modifying generate_multi_circuit_trajectory for a simplified pattern advancement and updating the plotting function. This will give you immediate control over visualizing a set number of repeating (but offset) circuits.

Are you ready to define how num_target_circuits_for_pattern_closure and pattern_skip_factor should influence the fixed_phi_advance_rad in the _generate_polar_turnaround_segment_fixed_phi_advance function?
My suggestion:
advancement_per_circuit_rad = (2 * math.pi / num_target_circuits_for_pattern_closure) * pattern_skip_factor
phi_span_for_each_turnaround_segment = advancement_per_circuit_rad / 2.0 (This implies the turnaround is the advancement).

This means current_phi_rad at the start of leg 1 of circuit j will be (j-1) * advancement_per_circuit_rad.
The phi_start for the first turnaround will be phi_end_of_leg1.
The phi_start for the second leg will be phi_end_of_turnaround1.
The phi_start for the second turnaround will be phi_end_of_leg2.
The phi_end_of_turnaround2 should then naturally align with j * advancement_per_circuit_rad.
