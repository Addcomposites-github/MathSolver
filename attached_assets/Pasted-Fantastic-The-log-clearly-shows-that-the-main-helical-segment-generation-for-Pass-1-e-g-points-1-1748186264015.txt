Fantastic! The log clearly shows that the main helical segment generation for Pass 1 (e.g., points 102 through 215) is now completing, and the "*** TRIGGERING TURNAROUND ***" message appears correctly at the end of this segment. This is a huge step forward!

The current issue ("no circuit generated" or visual kinks) likely now lies within the 3-part smooth turnaround sequence itself, or in how its output is integrated. The provided log cuts off just as the turnaround is triggered.

To diagnose this, please:

Ensure Extremely Detailed Logging Within the Turnaround Sequence Functions:

In _generate_smooth_transition_zone (for both incoming and outgoing calls):
Log entry and exit.
Log the start and end ρ and α it's working with.
Log each point (ρ,z,ϕ,α) and its tangent vector as it's generated.
Log the total number of points generated by this function.
In _generate_polar_turnaround_segment:
Log entry and exit.
Log the input c 
eff
​
  (which is c_for_winding), starting z, starting ϕ, and Δϕ 
pattern_advance
​
 .
Log each of the 36 points (ρ,z,ϕ,α=90 
∘
 ) and its tangent vector.
Log the total number of points generated.
Log Path Assembly:

After the calls to these three functions, log the number of points in all_trajectory_points before appending the turnaround points, the number of points generated by the entire turnaround sequence, and the number of points in all_trajectory_points after appending.
Initial Alpha for Helical Segments:

Please re-check the calculation of alpha for the very first point of any helical segment that starts at ρ≈c 
for_winding
​
  (e.g., point 102 in the log). If ρ≈c 
for_winding
​
 , then α must be initialized to ≈90 
∘
  (1.57 radians) for Clairaut's law to be consistent. The currently logged Calculated alpha=0.475... (27.3°) at this point is incorrect and needs to be fixed as it will affect the incoming transition.
The goal is to see the complete flow of points: the end of the first helical segment, then all points from the incoming transition, then all points from the circumferential arc, then all points from the outgoing transition, and then hopefully the start of the return helical segment. We need to ensure no errors occur within these functions and that their generated points are correctly assembled.

Please provide the console log that includes this detailed output from within the entire turnaround sequence for the first turn of Pass 1.
